{"title": "treasury management", "text": "Treasury management (or treasury operations) includes management of an enterprise's holdings, with the ultimate goal of managing the firm's liquidity and mitigating its operational-, financial- and reputational risk. Treasury Management includes a firm's collections, disbursements, concentration, investment and funding activities. In larger firms, it may also inhere the financial risk management function.\nIn general, a company's treasury operations comes under the control of the CFO, Vice-president / Director of Finance, or Treasurer; and is handled on a day-to-day basis by the organization's treasury staff, controller, or comptroller.\n\n\n== Banks ==\n\nMost banks have whole departments devoted to treasury management and supporting their clients' needs in this area.  Smaller banks are increasingly launching and/or expanding their treasury management functions and offerings, because of the market opportunity afforded by the recent economic environment (with banks of all sizes focusing on the clients they serve best), availability of highly seasoned treasury management professionals, access to industry standard, third-party technology providers' products and services tiered according to the needs of smaller clients, and investment in education and other best practices. A number of independent treasury management systems (TMS) are available, allowing enterprises to conduct treasury management internally.\nBank Treasuries may, in turn, have the following departments:\n\nA fixed income or money market desk that is devoted to buying and selling interest bearing securities.\nA foreign exchange desk that exchanges currencies as a service to the clients.\nA capital markets or equities desk that deals in shares listed on the stock market.In addition, the Treasury function may also have an asset liability management (ALM) desk that manages the risk of interest rate mismatch and liquidity; and a funds transfer pricing or pooling function that prices liquidity for business lines (asset sales teams) within the bank.\nBanks may or may not disclose the prices they charge for Treasury Management products.\n\n\n== Corporates ==\nFor non-banking entities, the terms Treasury Management and Cash Management are sometimes used interchangeably, while, in fact, the scope of treasury management is larger (and includes funding and investment activities mentioned above). \nThe significant core functions of a corporate treasury department include:\n\n\n=== Cash and liquidity management ===\nCash- and liquidity management is often described as treasury's 'primary duty.' Essentially, a company needs to be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due, i.e. to pay employees, suppliers, lenders and shareholders. This can also be described as the need to maintain liquidity, or solvency of the company: a company needs to have the funds available that will enable it to stay in business. In addition to dealing with payment transactions; cash management also includes planning, account organisation, cash flow monitoring, managing bank accounts, electronic banking, pooling and netting as well as the functions of in-house banks.\n\n\n=== Risk management ===\n\nRisk management is the discipline of managing financial risks to allow the company to meet its financial obligations and ensure predictable business performance. The aim of Risk Management is to identify, measure, and manage risks that could have a significant impact  on the business' goals. It is important to note that the objective is not to eliminate all risk. Taking risk is a critical part of any business \u2013 \"no risk no profit\"; see risk appetite and enterprise risk management.\nIt is important, however, to take risks only in areas that the business has competitive advantage. For example, an automotive company will want to take risks in design and engineering. but will want to avoid risks in currencies and interest rates. On the other hand, a bank will be in a position to take risks in currencies and interest rates but will avoid operational and regulatory risks.\nSee Financial risk management \u00a7 Application.\nTreasurers are then typically responsible for managing:\n\nLiquidity risk: the company is unable to fund itself or is unable to meet its obligations;\nMarket risk (or price risk): changes in market prices (typically foreign exchange, interest rates, commodities) cause losses to the business;\nCredit risk: that a counterparty default causes loss to the business;\nOperational risk: fraud or error cause losses to the business.\n\n\n=== Corporate Finance ===\nLooking after contacts with banks and rating agencies, as well as discussions with credit insurers and, if applicable, suppliers concerning periods allowed for payment, in conjunction with the procurement of finance, also form part of the treasurer's core business.\nSee Treasurer \u00a7 Corporate treasurers and Cash flow forecasting \u00a7 Corporate finance.\n\n\n== Regulation ==\nConcerns about systemic risk in the Over The Counter (OTC) derivatives markets, led to G20 leaders agreeing to new reforms being rolled out in 2015.   This new regulation, states that largely standardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded on electronic exchanges, and cleared centrally by Central Counterparty/Clearing House trades. Trades and their daily valuation should also be reported to authorized Trade Repositories and variation margins should be collected and maintained.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAssociation of Corporate Treasurers\nCash management\nCertified Treasury Professional\nFinancial risk management \u00a7 Corporate finance\nTreasurer \u00a7 Corporate treasurers\nTreasury management system\nTreasury services (IB product offering)\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "structured finance", "text": "Structured finance is a sector of finance \u2014 specifically financial law \u2014 that manages leverage and risk. Strategies may involve legal and corporate restructuring, off balance sheet accounting, or the use of financial instruments.\nSecuritization provides $15.6 trillion in financing and funded more than 50% of U.S. household debt last year. Through securitization and structured finance, more families, individuals, and businesses have access to essential credit, seamlessly and at a lower price.With more than 370 member institutions, the Structured Finance Association (SFA) is the leading trade association for the structured finance industry. SFA\u2019s purpose is to help its members and public policymakers grow credit availability and the real economy in a responsible manner. ISDA conducted market surveys of its Primary Membership to provide a summary of the notional amount outstanding of interest rate, credit, and equity derivatives, until 2010. The ISDA Margin Survey is also conducted annually to examine the state of collateral use and management among derivatives dealers and end-users. End-User Surveys are also conducted to collect information on usage of privately negotiated derivatives.\n\n\n== Structure ==\n\n\n=== Securitization ===\n\nStructured finance utilizes securitization to pool assets, creating novel financial instruments to enable better use of available capital or serve as a cheaper source of funding, especially for lower-rated originators\nOther uses include alternative funding (ture), reducing credit concentration and for risk transfer and risk management interest rates and liquidity.\n\n\n=== Tranching ===\nTranching refers to the creation of different classes of securities (typically with different credit ratings) from the same pool of assets. It is an important concept, because it is the system used to create different investment classes for the securities. Tranching allows the cash flow from the underlying asset to be diverted to various investor groups. The Bank for International Settlements Committee on the Global Financial System explains tranching as follows: \"A key goal of the tranching process is to create at least one class of securities whose rating is higher than the average rating of the underlying collateral pool or to create rated securities from a pool of unrated assets. This is accomplished through the use of credit support (enhancement), such as prioritization of payments to the different tranches.\"\n\n\n=== Credit enhancement ===\nCredit enhancement is key in creating a security that has a higher rating than the underlying asset pool. Credit enhancement can be created, for example, by issuing subordinate bonds.  The subordinate bonds are allocated any losses from the collateral before losses are allocated to the senior bonds, thus giving senior bonds a credit enhancement.  As a result, it is possible for defaults to occur in repayment of the underlying assets without affecting payments to holders of the senior bonds.  Also, many deals, typically those involving riskier collateral, such as subprime and Alt-A mortgages, use over-collateralization as well as subordination. In over-collateralization, the balance of the underlying assets (e.g., loans) is greater than the balance of the bonds, thus creating excess interest in the deal which acts as a \"cushion\" against reduction in value of the underlying assets. Excess interest can be used to offset collateral losses before losses are allocated to bondholders, thus providing another credit enhancement. A further credit enhancement involves the use of derivatives such as swap transactions, which effectively provide insurance, for a set fee, against a decrease in value.Monoline insurers play a critical role in modern-day Credit Enhancements; they are more effective in (a) off-balance-sheet models creating synthetic collateral, (b) sovereign ratings' enhancement with built-in asset derivatives and (c) cross border loans with receivables and counterparties in the domain and jurisdiction of the monoline insurer. The decision whether to use a monoline insurer or not often depends upon the cost of such cover vis-a-vis the improvement in pricing for the loan or bond issue by virtue of such credit enhancement.Ratings play an important role in structured finance for instruments that are meant to be sold to investors. Many mutual funds, governments, and private investors only buy instruments that have been rated by a known credit rating agency, like Moody's, Fitch or S&P Global Ratings.  New rules in the U.S. and Europe have tightened the requirements for ratings agencies.\n\n\n== Types ==\n\nThere are several main types of structured finance instruments.\nAsset-backed securities are bonds or notes based on pools of assets or collateralized by the cash flows from a specific pool of underlying assets.\nMortgage-backed securities are asset-backed securities, the cash flows from which are backed by the principal and interest payments of a set of mortgage loans.\nResidential mortgage-backed securities deal with residential homes, usually single family.\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities are for commercial real estate, such as malls or office complexes.\nCollateralized mortgage obligations are securitizations of mortgage-backed securities, typically involving multiple classes with differing levels of seniority.\nCollateralized debt obligations consolidate a group of fixed-income assets, such as high-yield debt or asset-backed securities, into a pool, which is then divided into various tranches.  Many CDOs are collateralized by various types of mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related assets.  An extension of these CDOs are \"synthetic\" CDOs which are collateralized by credit default swaps and other derivatives.Collateralized bond obligations are collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by corporate bonds.\nCollateralized loan obligations are collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by bank loans.\nCommercial real estate collateralized debt obligations are collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by commercial real estate loans and bonds.\nCredit derivatives are contracts to transfer the risk of the total return on a credit asset falling below an agreed level, without transfer of the underlying asset.\nCollateralized fund obligations are securitizations of private equity and hedge fund assets.\nInsurance linked securities are risk transfer instruments linked to insurance losses due to catastrophic events, which are generally seen as uncorrelated to traditional financial markets.\nPartial guaranteed structures\nFuture flow transactions\nLoan sell offs\nRevolving Credit Financing (property or traded goods)\n\n\n== See also ==\nPooled investment\nSecuritization\nThomson Financial League Tables\nStructurer\nStructured product\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nJobst, Andreas A.

{"title": "unsecured debt", "text": "In finance, unsecured debt refers to any type of debt or general obligation that is not protected by a guarantor, or collateralized by a lien on specific assets of the borrower in the case of a bankruptcy or liquidation or failure to meet the terms for repayment. Unsecured debts are sometimes called signature debt or personal loans. These differ from secured debt such as a mortgage, which is backed by a piece of real estate.\nIn the event of the bankruptcy of the borrower, the unsecured creditors have a general claim on the assets of the borrower after the specific pledged assets have been assigned to the secured creditors. The unsecured creditors usually realize a smaller proportion of their claims than the secured creditors.\nIn some legal systems, unsecured creditors who are also indebted to the insolvent debtor are able (and, in some jurisdictions, required) to set off the debts, so actually putting the unsecured creditor with a matured liability to the debtor in a pre-preferential position.\nUnder risk-based pricing, creditors tend to demand extremely high interest rates as a condition of extending unsecured debt. The maximum loss on a properly collateralized loan is the difference between the fair market value of the collateral and the outstanding debt. Thus, in the context of secured lending, the use of collateral reduces the size of the \"bet\" taken by the creditor on the debtor's creditworthiness. Without collateral, the creditor stands to lose the entire sum outstanding at the point of default and must boost the interest rate to price in that risk. Hence, although sufficiently high interest rates are considered usurious, unsecured loans would not be made at all without them.\nUnsecured loans are often sought out if additional capital is required although existing (but not necessarily all) assets have been pledged to secure prior debt. Secured lenders more often than not include language in the loan agreement that prevents debtor from assuming additional secured loans or pledging any assets to a creditor.\n\n\n== Examples of unsecured debt ==\n\n\n=== Types of unsecured debt ===\nCorporate unsecured debt \u2013 Since this type of debt assumes a greater amount of risk, corporations that have lower bond ratings (such as BBB) are classified as unsecured debt due to their higher default risk.\nPersonal loan \u2013 A personal loan is a loan which can be taken to meet unspecified financial needs, such as a wedding, travel, or medical emergencies. The interest paid on a personal loan is in most cases higher than that payable on secured loans.\nConsumer durable loan \u2013   In the retail sector or e-commerce, a growing number of merchants have embraced point-of-sale financing. It is commonly called consumer finance. On the spot no-cost EMI option is given. Even though, as per the rules and regulations of specific countries, there can never be no cost EMI option. Any lending institute is bound to take interest in some form or the other from you.\nStudent loans \u2013 This common type of debt is considered unsecured in many countries, because the loan is usually taken by a student (usually at graduate or undergraduate level) or the student's parent or legal guardian to pay tuition fees. The borrower is usually expected to pay back the loan after completing the course and securing a job, and because this is uncertain, lenders have very strict criteria for this product. The loan is only given after the lender assesses the student's academic record, the type of course the student is wishing to pursue and the quality of the university / institute where the student has secured admission for the aforementioned course, in addition to other standard criteria such as the guarantor's credit history, bank account statements, assets and holdings, etc. However, in rare cases, the borrower (usually a parent / legal guardian) of the student can pledge assets against the loan, thereby making it a secured loan. In recent times, a lot of salaried professionals also take loans to complete part time courses or certifications. In such cases however, the loan is not considered to be a student loan \u2013 it is simply categorized as a general personal loan.\n\n\n== National differences ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nFailure to make a payment on an unsecured debt may ultimately result in reporting the delinquent debt to a credit reporting agency or legal action. However, a nongovernmental unsecured creditor cannot seize any of your assets without a court judgment in the U.S.\nA creditor must file a complaint in state or federal court before a judgment can be made for or against the borrower.\n\n\n=== Malaysia ===\nIn Malaysia, there are personal loans for the private sector and for the government sector. The personal loan interest rate for the private sector is always higher than the government sector because it is of lower risk for the bank to lend to the government sector. The government will pay the salary of the civil servants through a payroll system known as the Biro Angkasa and the bank will deduct the monthly installment of the loan from the civil servant's salary through this system, before the salary is even released. An example of these loans are cooperative loans.\nInterest rates for personal loans in Malaysia are influenced by either one of these factors: loan amount, loan tenure and income of the applicant. In some cases, the bank will take 2 or even 3 of these factors to decide on the appropriate interest rate to be applied to the personal loan. In 2013, the Malaysian Central Bank introduces a new maximum loan tenure of 10 years for personal loan (previous maximum loan tenure was 25 years).\n\n\n=== Singapore ===\nIn Singapore, unsecured credit, including credit card debt and personal loans, can carry high interest rates due to the lack of collateral. To safeguard borrowers from excessive debt accumulation, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has implemented measures effective since January 1, 2018. These rules cap additional unsecured credit for borrowers whose outstanding debts exceed six times their monthly income, with a total credit limit not exceeding 12 times their monthly income. \nThe borrowing limit, set industry-wide, aims to prevent long-term reliance on unsecured credit and reduce debt accumulation. Banks must conduct credit bureau checks before granting new credit facilities or credit limit increases, ensuring loans align with borrowers' ability to repay. To manage debt effectively, borrowers can explore debt repayment plans and debt consolidation options. Understanding the rules and regulations can help borrowers maintain financial stability and make informed borrowing decisions in Singapore.\n\n\n== See also ==\nHigh-yield debt\nGuarantor loan\nMedical debt\nMerchant cash advance\nPeer-to-peer lending\nTerm deposit\nCredit card debt\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "bootstrapping", "text": "In general, bootstrapping usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to continue or grow without external input.\n\n\n== Etymology ==\nTall boots may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a boot hook tool to help pull the boots on. The saying \"to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps\" was already in use during the 19th century as an example of an impossible task.  The idiom dates at least to 1834, when it appeared in the Workingman's Advocate: \"It is conjectured that Mr. Murphee will now be enabled to hand himself over the Cumberland river or a barn yard fence by the straps of his boots.\" In 1860 it appeared in a comment on philosophy of mind: \"The attempt of the mind to analyze itself [is] an effort analogous to one who would lift himself by his own bootstraps.\" Bootstrap as a metaphor, meaning to better oneself by one's own unaided efforts, was in use in 1922. This metaphor spawned additional metaphors for a series of self-sustaining processes that proceed without external help.\nThe term is sometimes attributed to a story in Rudolf Erich Raspe's The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen, but in that story Baron Munchausen pulls himself (and his horse) out of a swamp by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), not by his bootstraps \u2013  and no explicit reference to bootstraps has been found elsewhere in the various versions of the Munchausen tales.\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\n\n=== Computing ===\nIn computer technology, the term bootstrapping refers to language compilers that are able to be coded in the same language. (For example, a C compiler is now written in the C language. Once the basic compiler is written, improvements can be iteratively made, thus pulling the language up by its bootstraps). Also, booting usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, the kernel will load the operating system which will then take care of loading other device drivers and software as needed.\n\n\n==== Software loading and execution ====\n\nBooting is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software. The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage, a relatively small and simple program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage. It is in this sense that the computer \"pulls itself up by its bootstraps\"; i.e., it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off to firmware and software which is loaded into main memory. Booting often involves processes such as performing self-tests, loading configuration settings, loading a BIOS, resident monitors, a hypervisor, an operating system, or utility software.\nThe computer term bootstrap began as a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a hardwired program to read a bootstrap program from an input unit. The computer would then execute the bootstrap program, which caused it to read more program instructions. It became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions. As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1953.\n\n\n==== Software development ====\nBootstrapping can also refer to the development of successively more complex, faster programming environments. The simplest environment will be, perhaps, a very basic text editor (e.g., ed) and an assembler program. Using these tools, one can write a more complex text editor, and a simple compiler for a higher-level language and so on, until one can have a graphical IDE and an extremely high-level programming language.\nHistorically, bootstrapping also refers to an early technique for computer program development on new hardware. The technique described in this paragraph has been replaced by the use of a cross compiler executed by a pre-existing computer. Bootstrapping in program development began during the 1950s when each program was constructed on paper in decimal code or in binary code, bit by bit (1s and 0s), because there was no high-level computer language, no compiler, no assembler, and no linker. A tiny assembler program was hand-coded for a new computer (for example the IBM 650) which converted a few instructions into binary or decimal code: A1. This simple assembler program was then rewritten in its just-defined assembly language but with extensions that would enable the use of some additional mnemonics for more complex operation codes. The enhanced assembler's source program was then assembled by its predecessor's executable (A1) into binary or decimal code to give A2, and the cycle repeated (now with those enhancements available), until the entire instruction set was coded, branch addresses were automatically calculated, and other conveniences (such as conditional assembly, macros, optimisations, etc.) established. This was how the early Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program (SOAP) was developed. Compilers, linkers, loaders, and utilities were then coded in assembly language, further continuing the bootstrapping process of developing complex software systems by using simpler software.\nThe term was also championed by Doug Engelbart to refer to his belief that organizations could better evolve by improving the process they use for improvement (thus obtaining a compounding effect over time). His SRI team that developed the NLS hypertext system applied this strategy by using the tool they had developed to improve the tool.\n\n\n==== Compilers ====\n\nThe development of compilers for new programming languages first developed in an existing language but then rewritten in the new language and compiled by itself, is another example of the bootstrapping notion.\n\n\n==== Installers ====\n\nDuring the installation of computer programs, it is sometimes necessary to update the installer or package manager itself. The common pattern for this is to use a small executable bootstrapper file (e.g., setup.exe) which updates the installer and starts the real installation after the update. Sometimes the bootstrapper also installs other prerequisites for the software during the bootstrapping process.\n\n\n==== Overlay networks ====\n\nA bootstrapping node, also known as a rendezvous host, is a node in an overlay network that provides initial configuration information to newly joining nodes so that they may successfully join the overlay network.\n\n\n==== Discrete-event simulation ====\n\nA type of computer simulation called discrete-event simulation represents the operation of a system as a chronological sequence of events. A technique called bootstrapping the simulation model is used, which bootstraps initial data points using a pseudorandom number generator to schedule an initial set of pending events, which schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its steady state\u2014the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.\n\n\n==== Artificial intelligence and machine learning ====\n\nBootstrapping is a technique used to iteratively improve a classifier's performance. Typically, multiple classifiers will be trained on different sets of the input data, and on prediction tasks the output of the different classifiers will be combined.\nSeed AI is a hypothesized type of artificial intelligence capable of recursive self-improvement. Having improved itself, it would become better at improving itself, potentially leading to an exponential increase in intelligence. No such AI is known to exist, but it remains an active field of research. Seed AI is a significant part of some theories about the technological singularity: proponents believe that the development of seed AI will rapidly yield ever-smarter intelligence (via bootstrapping) and thus a new era.\n\n\n=== Statistics ===\n\nBootstrapping is a resampling technique used to obtain estimates of summary statistics.\n\n\n=== Business ===\nBootstrapping in business means starting a business without external help or working capital. Entrepreneurs in the startup development phase of their company survive through internal cash flow and are very cautious with their expenses. Generally at the start of a venture, a small amount of money will be set aside for the bootstrap process. Bootstrapping can also be a supplement for econometric models. Bootstrapping was also expanded upon in the book Bootstrap Business by Richard Christiansen, the Harvard Business Review article The Art of Bootstrapping and the follow-up book The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses by Amar Bhide. There is also an entire bible written on how to properly bootstrap by Seth Godin.\nExperts have noted that several common stages exist for bootstrapping a business venture:\n\nBirth-stage: This is the first stage to bootstrapping by which the entrepreneur utilizes any personal savings or borrowed and/or invested money from friends and family to launch the business. It is also possible for the business owner to be running or working for another organization at the time which may help to fuel their business and cover initial expenses.\nFunding from sales to consumers-stage: In this particular stage, money from customers is used to keep the business operating afloat. Once expenses caused by normal day-to-day business operations are met, the rate growth usually increases.\nOutsourcing-stage: At this point in the company's existence, the entrepreneur in question normally concentrates on the specific operating activities. This is the time in which entrepreneurs decide how to improve and upgrade equipment (subsequently increasing output) or even employing new staff members. At this point in time, the company may seek loans or even lean on other methods of additional funding such as venture capital to help with expansion and other improvements.There are many types of companies that are eligible for bootstrapping. Early-stage companies that do not necessarily require large influxes of capital (particularly from outside sources) qualify. This would specifically allow for flexibility for the business and time to grow. Serial entrepreneur companies could also possibly reap the benefits of bootstrapping. These are organizations whereby the founder has money from the sale of a previous companies they can use to invest.There are different methods of bootstrapping. Future business owners aspiring to use bootstrapping as way of launching their product or service often use the following methods:\n\nUsing accessible money from their own personal savings.\nManaging their working capital in a way that minimizes their company's accounts receivable.\nCashing out 401k retirement funds and pay them off at later dates.\nGradually increasing the business\u2019 accounts payable through delaying payments or even renting equipment instead of buying them.Bootstrapping is often considered successful. When taking into account statistics provided by Fundera, approximately 77% of small business rely on some sort of personal investment and or savings in order to fund their startup ventures. The average small business venture requires approximately $10,000 in startup capital with a third of small business launching with less than $5,000 bootstrapped.\nBased on startup data presented by Entrepreneur.com, in comparison other methods of funding, bootstrapping is more commonly used than others. \u201c0.91% of startups are funded by angel investors, while 0.05% are funded by VCs. In contrast, 57 percent of startups are funded by personal loans and credit, while 38 percent receive funding from family and friends.\u201dSome examples of successful entrepreneurs that have used bootstrapping in order to finance their businesses include serial entrepreneur Mark Cuban. He has publicly endorsed bootstrapping claiming that \u201cIf you can start on your own \u2026 do it by [yourself] without having to go out and raise money.\u201d When asked why he believed this approach was most necessary, he replied, \u201cI think the biggest mistake people make is once they have an idea and the goal of starting a business, they think they have to raise money. And once you raise money, that\u2019s not an accomplishment, that\u2019s an obligation\u201d because \u201cnow, you\u2019re reporting to whoever you raised money from.\u201dBootstrapped companies such as Apple Inc. (APPL), eBay Inc. (EBAY) and Coca-Cola Co. have also claimed that they attribute some of their success to the fact that this method of funding enables them to remain highly focused on a specific array of profitable product.\nThere are advantages to bootstrapping. Entrepreneurs are in full control  over the finances of the business and can maintain control over the organization's inflows and outflows of cash. Equity is retained by the owner and can be redistributed at their discretion. There is less liability or opportunity to accumulate debt from other financial sources. Bootstrapping often leads to entrepreneurs operating their businesses with freedom to do as they see fit; in a similar fashion to sole proprietors. This is an effective method if the business owner's goal is to be able to fund future investments back into the business. Besides the direct stakeholders of the business, entrepreneurs do not have to answer to a board of investors which could possibly pressure them into making certain decisions beneficial to them.\nThere are also drawbacks of bootstrapping. Personal liability is one. Credit lines usually must be established in owner's name which is the downfall of some companies due to debt being accumulated from various credit cards, etc. All financial risks pertaining to the business in question all fall on the owner's shoulders. The owner is forced to put either their own or their family/friend's investments in jeopardy in the event of the business failing. Possible legal issues are another drawback. There have been some cases in which entrepreneurs have been sued by family or even close friends for the improper use of their bootstrapped money. Because financing is limited to what the owner or company makes, this can create a ceiling which prohibits room for growth. Without the aid of occasional external sources of funding, entrepreneurs can find themselves unable to promote employees or even expand their businesses. A lack of money could possibly lead to a reduction of the quality of the service or product meant to be provided. Certain investors tend to be well-respected within specific industries and running a company without their backing or support could cause pivotal opportunities to be lost. Personal stress to entrepreneur or business owner in question is common. Tackling funding by themselves has often led to stressful times for certain individuals.\nStartups can grow by reinvesting profits in its own growth if bootstrapping costs are low and return on investment is high. This financing approach allows owners to maintain control of their business and forces them to spend with discipline. In addition, bootstrapping allows startups to focus on customers rather than investors, thereby increasing the likelihood of creating a profitable business. This leaves startups with a better exit strategy with greater returns. \nLeveraged buyouts, or highly leveraged or \"bootstrap\" transactions, occur when an investor acquires a controlling interest in a company's equity and where a significant percentage of the purchase price is financed through leverage, i.e. borrowing by the acquired company. \nBootstrapping in finance refers to the method to create the spot rate curve. Operation Bootstrap (Operaci\u00f3n Manos a la Obra) refers to the ambitious projects that industrialized Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century.\n\n\n=== Biology ===\nRichard Dawkins in his book River Out of Eden used the computer bootstrapping concept to explain how biological cells differentiate: \"Different cells receive different combinations of chemicals, which switch on different combinations of genes, and some genes work to switch other genes on or off. And so the bootstrapping continues, until we have the full repertoire of different kinds of cells.\"\n\n\n==== Phylogenetics ====\nBootstrapping analysis gives a way to judge the strength of support for clades on phylogenetic trees. A number is written by a node, which reflects the percentage of bootstrap trees which also resolve the clade at the endpoints of that branch.\n\n\n=== Law ===\n\nBootstrapping is a rule preventing the admission of hearsay evidence in conspiracy cases.\n\n\n=== Linguistics ===\n\nBootstrapping is a theory of language acquisition.\n\n\n=== Physics ===\n\n\n==== Quantum theory ====\n\nBootstrapping is using very general consistency criteria to determine the form of a quantum theory from some assumptions on the spectrum of particles or operators.\n\n\n==== Magnetically confined fusion plasmas ====\nIn tokamak fusion devices, bootstrapping refers to the process in which a bootstrap current is self-generated by the plasma, which reduces or eliminates the need for an external current driver. Maximising the bootstrap current is a major goal of advanced tokamak designs.\n\n\n==== Inertially confined fusion plasmas ====\nBootstrapping in inertial confinement fusion refers to the alpha particles produced in the fusion reaction providing further heating to the plasma. This heating leads to ignition and an overall energy gain.\n\n\n=== Electronics ===\n\nBootstrapping is a form of positive feedback in analog circuit design.\n\n\n=== Electric power grid ===\n\nAn electric power grid is almost never brought down intentionally. Generators and power stations are started and shut down as necessary. A typical power station requires power for start up prior to being able to generate power. This power is obtained from the grid, so if the entire grid is down these stations cannot be started.\nTherefore, to get a grid started, there must be at least a small number of power stations that can start entirely on their own. A black start is the process of restoring a power station to operation without relying on external power. In the absence of grid power, one or more black starts are used to bootstrap the grid.\n\n\n=== Cellular networks ===\n\nA Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) is an intermediary element in cellular networks which provides application independent functions for mutual authentication of user equipment and servers unknown to each other and for 'bootstrapping' the exchange of secret session keys afterwards. The term 'bootstrapping' is related to building a security relation with a previously unknown device first and to allow installing security elements (keys) in the device and the BSF afterwards.\n\n\n=== Nuclear Power Plant ===\nA nuclear power plant always needs to have a way to remove decay heat, which is usually done with electrical cooling pumps.  But in the rare case of a complete loss of electrical power, this can still be achieved by booting a turbine generator.  As steam builds up in the steam generator, it can be used to power the turbine generator (initially with no oil pumps, circ water pumps, or condensation pumps).  Once the turbine generator is producing electricity, the auxiliary pumps can be powered on, and the reactor cooling pumps can be run momentarily.  Eventually the steam pressure will become insufficient to power the turbine generator, and the process can be shut down in reverse order.  The process can be repeated until no longer needed. This can cause great damage to the turbine generator, but more importantly, it saves the nuclear reactor.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCausal loop, also known as Bootstrap paradox \u2013 Theoretical paradox resulting from time travelPages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nConceptual metaphor \u2013 In cognitive linguistics, relating conceptual domains\nHoratio Alger myth \u2013 American novelist (1832\u20131899)Pages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nM\u00fcnchhausen trilemma \u2013 A thought experiment used to demonstrate the impossibility of proving any truth\nNeurathian bootstrap \u2013 Philosophical analogy about knowledgePages displaying short descriptions of redirect targets\nRobert A.

{"title": "subordinated debt", "text": "In finance, subordinated debt (also known as subordinated loan, subordinated bond, subordinated debenture or junior debt) is debt which ranks after other debts if a company falls into liquidation or bankruptcy.\nSuch debt is referred to as 'subordinate', because the debt providers (the lenders) have subordinate status in relationship to the normal debt. \nSubordinated debt has a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation during bankruptcy, and ranks below: the liquidator, government tax authorities and senior debt holders in the hierarchy of creditors. Debt instruments with the lowest seniority are known as subordinated debt instruments. Because subordinated debts are only repayable after other debts have been paid, they are more risky for the lender of the money. The debts may be secured or unsecured. Subordinated loans typically have a lower credit rating, and, therefore, a higher yield than senior debt. \nA typical example for this would be when a promoter of a company invests money in the form of debt rather than in the form of stock. In the case of liquidation (e.g. the company winds up its affairs and dissolves), the promoter would be paid just before stockholders \u2014 assuming there are assets to distribute after all other liabilities and debts have been paid.\nWhile subordinated debt may be issued in a public offering, major shareholders and parent companies are more frequent buyers of subordinated loans.  These entities may prefer to inject capital in the form of debt, but, due to the close relationship to the issuing company, they may be more willing to accept a lower rate of return on subordinated debt than general investors would.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nA particularly important example of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks.  Before the 2007\u20132008 financial crisis, subordinated debt was issued periodically by most large banking corporations in the U.S.  Subsequently the private credit middle-market increased debt issuance.  Subordinated debt can be expected to be especially risk-sensitive because subordinated debt holders have claims on bank assets only after senior debtholders and they lack the upside gain enjoyed by shareholders.This status of subordinated debt makes it perfect for experimenting with the significance of market discipline, via the signaling effect of secondary market prices of subordinated debt (and, where relevant, the issue price of these bonds initially in the primary markets). \nFrom the perspective of policy-makers and regulators, the potential benefit from having banks issue subordinated debt is that the markets and their information-generating capabilities are enrolled in the \"supervision\" of the financial condition of the banks.  This, hopefully, creates both an early-warning system, like the so-called \"canary in the mine\", and, also hopefully, an incentive for bank management to act prudently, thus helping to offset the moral hazard that can otherwise exist, especially in a circumstance where banks have limited equity and deposits are insured. This role of subordinated debt has attracted increasing attention from policy analysts in recent years.For a second example of subordinated debt, consider asset-backed securities. These are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches get paid back first; the subordinated tranches later. \nA third example is mezzanine debt.\n\n\n== Use ==\nSubordinated bonds are regularly issued (as mentioned earlier) as part of the securitization of debt, such as in the issue of asset-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations or collateralized debt obligations. Corporate issuers tend to prefer not to issue subordinated bonds because of the higher interest rate required to compensate for the higher risk, but may be forced to do so if indentures on earlier issues mandate their status as senior bonds. \nAlso, subordinated debt may be combined with preferred stock to create so-called monthly income preferred stock, a hybrid security paying dividends for the lender and funded as interest expense by the issuer.\n\n\n== See also ==\nTier 2 capital\nBasel II\nBank condition\nBanking regulation\nCAMELS rating\nPerpetual subordinated debt\nStructural subordination\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFederal Register\nFreddie Mac\nFINRA"}
{"title": "stamp duty", "text": "Stamp duty is a tax that is levied on single property purchases or documents (including, historically, the majority of legal documents such as cheques, receipts, military commissions, marriage licences and land transactions). A physical revenue stamp had to be attached to or impressed upon the document to show that stamp duty had been paid before the document was legally effective. More modern versions of the tax no longer require an actual stamp.\nThe duty is thought to have originated in Venice in 1604, being introduced (or re-invented) in Spain in the 1610s, the Spanish Netherlands in the 1620s, France in 1651, Denmark in 1657, Prussia in 1682 and England in 1694.\n\n\n== Usage by country ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nThe Australian Federal Government does not levy stamp duty. However, stamp duties are levied by the Australian states on various instruments (written documents) and transactions. Stamp duty laws can differ significantly between all eight jurisdictions. The rates of stamp duty also differ between the jurisdictions (typically up to 5.5%) as do the nature of instruments and transactions subject to duty. Some jurisdictions no longer require a physical document to attract what is now often referred to as \"transaction duty\".\nMajor forms of duty include transfer duty on the purchase of land (both freehold and leasehold), buildings, fixtures, plant and equipment, intangible business assets (such as goodwill and intellectual property) debts and other types of dutiable property. Another key type of duty is landholder duty, which is imposed on the acquisition of shares in a company or units in a trust that holds land above a certain value threshold.\n\n\n=== Denmark ===\nA temporary stamp duty was introduced in 1657 to finance the war with Sweden. It was made permanent in 1660 and remains on the statute book although it has been substantially altered. Most stamp duties were abolished from 1 January 2000 and the present act only provides for stamp duties on insurance policies. Stamp duties on land registration were renamed and transferred to a separate statute but remain essentially the same, i.e. 0.6% on deeds and 1.5% loans secured against real estate.\n\n\n=== European Union ===\nStamp duty in the EU is limited in scope by the Capital Duties Directive (Council Directive 69/335/EEC of 17 July 1969 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital). This states that transactions subject to capital duty shall only be taxable in the Member State in whose territory the effective centre of management of a capital company is situated at the time when such transactions take place. When the effective centre of management of a capital company is situated in a third country and its registered office is situated in a Member State, transactions subject to capital duty shall be taxable in the Member State where the registered office is situated. When the registered office and the effective centre of management of a capital company are situated in a third country, the supplying of fixed or working capital to a branch situated in a Member State may be taxed in the Member State in whose territory the branch is situated.The spirit of the Council Directive 2008/7/EC of 12 February 2008 concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital is that capital duty interferes with the free movement of capital, and it prohibits capital duties altogether on the issue of securities (as opposed to the transfer). The Directive acknowledges that the best solution would be to abolish the duty, but allows those Member States that charged the duty as at 1 January 2006 may continue to do so under strict conditions. With this stamp duty Directive, Member States may not levy indirect tax on the raising of capital to capital companies in:\n\ncontributions of capital;\nloans or services provided as part of contributions of capital;\nregistration or other formalities required before commencing business because of the company's legal form;\nalteration of the instruments constituting the company, particularly when involving the conversion into a different type of company, the transfer of centre of effective management or registered office from one Member State to another, a change in the company's objects or the extension of its period of existence;\nrestructuring operations.Indirect taxes are also entirely prohibited on the issue of certain securities and debentures.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nAccording to Schedule 1 of Hong Kong Stamp Duty Ordinance Cap.117 (SDO), Stamp duty applies to some legal binding documents as classified into 4 heads:\n\nHead 1: All sale or lease transactions in Hong Kong immovable property.\nHead 2: The transfer of Hong Kong Stock.\nHead 3: All Hong Kong bearer instruments.\nHead 4: Any duplicates and counterparts of the above documents.One example is shares of companies which are either incorporated in Hong Kong or listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  Other than the said shares, HK Stock is defined as shares and marketable securities, units in unit trusts, and rights to subscribe for or to be allotted stock.  Stamp duty on a conveyance on sale of land is charged at progressive rates ranging from 1.5% to 8.5% of the amount of consideration.  The maximum rate of 8.5% applies where the consideration exceeds HK$21,739,130.In addition, in response to the overheated property market, the Government has proposed in 2010 and 2012 two further types of stamp duties in respect of conveyances on sale of land:\n\nHead 1AA / 1B: Special Stamp Duty (which applies to residential properties resold within 3 years after purchase)\nHead 1AAB / 1C: Buyer's Stamp Duty (which applies to residential properties purchased by non-Hong Kong Permanent Residents or companies)The Special Stamp Duty was enacted by the Legislative Council on 29 June 2011 and would take effect from 20 November 2010. An enhanced rate of the Special Stamp Duty and the Buyer's Stamp Duty was enacted by the Legislative Council on 27 February 2014 but would take effect retrospectively from 27 October 2012.\nThe government regularly updates its Stamp Duty laws and in addition to the above, several other amendments have now been published which are also aimed at cooling the property market. Third party calculators make it easier to understand the complex set of rules, making it easier to under the latest cost of buying or selling.\nReal Estate Agencies do usually arrange the stamping for Tenancy Agreements for residential apartments.\n\n\n=== India ===\nIndian laws require stamp duty payments on a limited category of transaction documents. Broadly, documents affecting rights and titles to property require stamp duties to be paid. The central government requires stamp duty to be paid on several classes of transaction documents, primarily focused on securities, under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. In addition, stamp duty may be charged by the state government for other transactions depending on state-specific legislation. For example, Maharashtra state's stamp duty law is governed by the Maharashtra Stamp Act, 1958 (Bombay Act LX of 1958 ).\n\n\n=== Indonesia ===\nStamp duty (materai) is in use in Indonesia on a variety of legal documents. It continues to be necessary to stamp the document.\n\n\n=== Ireland ===\nIn the Republic of Ireland stamp duties are levied on various items including (but not limited to) credit cards, debit cards, ATM cards, cheques, property transfers, and certain court documents. Stamp duty was formerly a graduated  progressive tax with more expensive the house bought the greater the stamp duty rate. The top rate slowly increased from 0.5% in 1882 to 3% in 1947, 5% in 1973, 6% in 1975, reaching its peak at 9% in 1997. The budget of 2008 inaugurated a series of rate reductions. After 2011 the stamp duty tax is set at 1% for residential properties up to \u20ac1 million and 2% on the remaining amount. Non-residential real property, building, insurance policies, the intangible business property goodwill are taxed at 2%. A lease for property of any type is taxed according to the lease duration, 1% of the average annual rent, or the market rate whichever is greater, if 35 years or less, 6% up to 100 years, and 12% for a lease of more than 100 years duration. Counterparts (duplicate copies) of documents are taxed the lesser of \u20ac12.50 or the duty on the original document. The value of property for stamp duty excludes VAT. Gifts are taxed at market value. Several exemptions including those for gifts between close relatives and first time home buyers expired in 2010. The transfer of stocks and marketable securities is taxed at 1% if over \u20ac1,000 or if a gift. Stock warrants in bearer form are taxed at 3% of the value of the shares, and the issue of (new) bearer warrants was prohibited effective 1 June 2015.\n\n\n=== Singapore ===\nFrom 1998, stamp duty in Singapore only applies to documents relating to immovable property, stocks and shares. Purchases of Singapore property or shares traded on the Singapore Exchange, are subject to stamp duty. The Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) mandates stamp duty payment within 14 days from signing of the document if done in Singapore and 30 days if the document is signed overseas. Failure in payment within the fixed time entails heavy penalty.Applicable rates and more information can be obtained from Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore. Legislation covering Singapore Stamp Duties are found in the Stamp Duties Act.\n\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSwedish law applies a stamp duty on property deeds, at 1.5% of the purchase value. In addition, a stamp duty of 2.0% is levied on new mortgage securities (\"pantbrev\") for properties.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\n\n\"Stamp Duty Reserve Tax\" (SDRT) was introduced on agreements to transfer certain shares and other securities in 1986, albeit with a relief for intermediaries such as market makers and large banks that are members of a qualifying exchange.  \"Stamp Duty Land Tax\" (SDLT), a new transfer tax derived from stamp duty, was introduced for land and property transactions from 1 December 2003.  SDLT is not a stamp duty, but a form of self-assessed transfer tax charged on \"land transactions\".\nOn 24 March 2010, Chancellor Alistair Darling introduced two significant changes to UK Stamp Duty Land Tax. For first-time buyers purchasing a property under \u00a3250,000, Stamp Duty Land Tax was abolished for the next two years. This measure was offset by a rise from 4% to 5% in Stamp Duty Land Tax on residential properties costing more than \u00a31 million.Further reforms were announced in December 2014, so that rates are now paid only on the part of the property price within each tax band.In the 2015 Autumn Statement the Chancellor announced that buyers of second homes (whether Buy to let or holiday homes) would pay an additional 3% with effect from April 2016.\nThe Budget 2017 abolished Stamp Duty for first-time home buyers in England and Wales purchasing homes up to \u00a3300,000, saving first-time buyers up to \u00a35,000. Additionally first-time buyers spending up to \u00a3500,000 will only pay Stamp Duty @ 5% on the amount in excess of \u00a3300,000. Those spending over \u00a3500,000 will pay full Stamp Duty.Government defines first-time buyers as \"... an individual or individuals who have never owned an interest in a residential property in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the world and who intends to occupy the property as their main residence.\"\nStamp Duty Land Tax only applies throughout England and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, SDLT was replaced by Land and Buildings Transaction Tax on April 1, 2015. In Wales, Land Transaction Tax was introduced in May 2018.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nAlthough the federal government formerly imposed various documentary stamp taxes on deeds, notes, insurance premiums and other transactional documents, in modern times such taxes are only imposed by states. Typically when real estate is transferred or sold, a real estate transfer tax will be collected at the time of registration of the deed in the public records. In addition, many states impose a tax on mortgages or other instruments securing loans against real property. This tax, known variously as a mortgage tax, intangibles tax, or documentary stamp tax, is also usually collected at the time of registration of the mortgage or deed of trust with the recording authority.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinancial transaction tax\nStamp duty in the United Kingdom\nTransfer tax\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\"Stamp Duty on Shares and Its Effect on Share Prices\", by Bond, Steve; Hawkins, Mike; Klemm, Alexander, FinanzArchiv: Public Finance Analysis, Volume 61, Number 3, Article (2005)\n\n\n== External links =="}
{"title": "X-inefficiency", "text": "X-inefficiency is a concept used in economics to describe instances where firms go through internal inefficiency resulting in higher production costs than required for a given output. This inefficiency is a result of various factors such as outdated technology, Inefficient production processes, poor management and lack of competition resulting in lower profits and higher prices for consumers. The concept of X-inefficiency was introduced by Harvey Leibenstein.\n\nThe difference between the potential and actual cost is known as X-Inefficiency. In normal instances, a firm could have an average cost curve at potential AC, however due to inefficiency, its actual average costs are higher.\nin 1966, Harvard University Professor Harvey Leibenstein first introduced the concept of X-inefficiency in his paper \"Allocative Efficiency vs. X- Efficiency\", which was published in American Economic Review. X-Inefficiency refers to a firm's inability to fully utilize its resources, resulting in an output level that falls short of the maximum potential achievable given the resources and environment which is referred to as the efficiency frontier.\nMore so, X-inefficiency focuses on the importance of competition and innovation in promoting efficiency and reducing costs for firms, followed by higher profits and better output and prices for consumers.\nX-inefficiency pin out irrational actions performed by firms in the market.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe difference between the actual and minimum cost of production for a given output produces X-inefficiency.Companies will incur X-Inefficiency as a result of lack of motivation to control its costs, which brings the average cost of production exceeds costs actually required for production. For example, the company have a potential potential cost curve. However, due to the lack incentive to motivate on control costs, the company's actual cost curve is at a higher position compared to the potential cost curve.The phenomenon of X-inefficiency is in relation to the allocation of effort, especially the managerial effort.Mainstream economic theory tends to assume that the management of firms act to maximize profit by minimizing the inputs used to produce a given level of output.Competition energizes firms to seek productive efficiency gains and produce at lowest unit costs or risk losing sales to more efficient rivals. With market forms other than perfect competition, such as monopoly, productive inefficiency can persist, because the lack of competition makes it possible to use inefficient production techniques and still stay in business. In addition to monopoly, sociologists have identified a number of ways in which markets may be organizationally embedded, and thus may depart in behavior from economic theory.Organizational slack occurs when firms opt to employ more resources than are needed to produce a given level of output. Unused capacity results in X-inefficiency. Organizational slack can be explained by the principal-agent problem. In companies ownership and management are separate. Shareholders (the principal) elect directors (the agent) to act on their behalf and maximize shareholder value. Managers may take decisions that maximize their own and not shareholder objectives e.g. hiring extra staff to reduce manager workloads. This increases unit costs.\nX-inefficiency only looks at the outputs that are produced with given inputs. It doesn't take account of whether the inputs are the best ones to be using, or whether the outputs are the best ones to be producing. For example, a firm that employs brain surgeons to dig ditches might still be X-efficient, even though reallocating the brain surgeons to curing the sick would be more efficient for society overall. In this sense, X-inefficiency focuses on productive efficiency and minimising costs rather than allocative efficiency and maximising welfare. For more extensive discussions, see Sickles and Zelenyuk (2019, p. 1-8, 469) and references therein.\n\n\n== Arguments about X-inefficiency ==\nBased on the assumption that the non-trade output of the firm is zero, Leibenstein argues that the X-inefficiency results from the lack of motivation of the resource owners to produce less than the maximum technical output of the trade goods. Leibenstein also argued that sometimes firms are not maximising their profits because there may be a certain level of efficiency, considering the human element which introduced by Leibenstein\n\n\n== Causes to X-inefficiency ==\nMonopoly Effect - A monopoly is a price maker in that its choice of output level affects the price paid by consumers. Consequently, a monopoly tends to price at a point where price is greater than long-run average costs. X-inefficiency, however tends to increase average costs causing further divergence from the economically efficient outcome. The sources of X-inefficiency have been ascribed to things such as over investment and empire building by managers, lack of motivation stemming from a lack of competition, and pressure by labor unions to pay above-market wages.Suggested by Bergsman, The sum of X-inefficiency and monopoly returns is much larger than costs of mis-allocation.\nIn reality, industries with strong monopoly capacity will be more restricted by legal regulations. These regulations can impose competitive pressure on companies and prevent the industry turning into a true monopoly. Meanwhile, these artificial pressure of regulations can induce competitive pressure to companies, thus improving X-inefficiency.When a particular market lacks competition, companies that are monopoly would have incentive to increase their prices to in order to make super-profits. In addition, the low pressure from having no competition would lead to difficulty controlling costs resulting in potential inefficiencies.Government Effect - A state owned firm may not be operating to make profit, therefore it would have no incentive to cut costs.\nPrincipal Agent Effect- Shareholders typically have a primary goal of maximizing profits and reducing costs, managers and employees may opt to have different priorities for example they may seek to keep costs low up to a point of maintaining job security, but allow costs to increase if it means improving the quality of their work experience.Motivation Effect- Workers and managers may be demotivated to work diligently. This arises from various factors such as strained industrial relations, As a result employees may purposefully take extended breaks and not exert their best effort in order to increase profitability.\n\n\n== Measurements of X-inefficiency ==\nCost Efficiency Analysis -  To analyze the efficiency of firms or organizations in a particular industry or sector, a technique called cost frontier analysis is utilized. This involves approximating the minimum cost required to produce a specific level of output, which serves as the cost frontier. Companies that incur costs exceeding the frontier are deemed inefficient. Statistical methods are utilized in cost frontier analysis to estimate the frontier and gauge the extent of inefficiency within the firms.Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) - is a technique that does not rely on assumptions or preset parameters, and is used to assess the relative effectiveness of companies or groups. It evaluates how well firms use various inputs and outputs, and determines the highest level of efficiency attainable with the available resources. Ineffective firms are those that do not achieve this maximum level of efficiency.Stochastic frontier analysis: - is a method that requires the estimation of a production function that focuses the unpredictable fluctuations in both inputs and outputs. The resulting result is then utilized to determined the efficiency of individual firms. When using this approach, any company that operates below the estimated level of efficiency is considered inefficient.\n\n\n== Solutions of X-inefficiency ==\nGovernment Regulation - Rules and regulations set by the government on firms can enhance market efficiency. Studies by Sappington and Stiglitz (1987) show that regulations can address market failures such as information asymmetry, externalities and natural monopolies thus reducing x-inefficiency. Removing  Barriers to entry for new companies can force existing companies to operate more efficiently to stay competitive.Antitrust Laws - The main goal of antitrust laws is to foster competitions and hinder the establishment of monopolies. In their paper, Hovenkamp et al. (2011), examine the function of antitrust laws in advancing economic effectiveness through the deterrence of anti-competitive actions, including but not limited to, price-fixing, bid-rigging, and exclusive dealing.Some solutions to X-inefficiency include increasing competition in the market, implementing better management practices, and improving employee motivation and training. Implementing better management practices aid in the reducing x-inefficiency. For example lean management method concentrate on minimizing waste and increasing efficiency. Technology plays an important role in streamlining processes and lowering labor expense.Another Approach of minimizing x-inefficiency involves Management input. Enhancing employee motivation and training - to help employees acquire the expertise and knowledge for optimal performance, can lower wastage, improve efficiency and productivity. Companies could offer rewards and incentives to employees that bring new innovative manufacturing process aimed at boosting efficiency and reducing waste.\n\n\n== Conclusion ==\nIn conclusion, X-inefficiency refers to the inefficiencies within a company that result in higher production costs than necessary for a given output. These inefficiencies can stem from a variety of factors, including outdated technology, inefficient production processes, poor management, and a lack of competition. X-inefficiency underscores the importance of competition and innovation in fostering efficiency, which can reduce costs for companies, resulting in increased profits and better output and prices for consumers. However, X-inefficiency only focuses on productive efficiency and minimizing costs, not on allocative efficiency and maximizing welfare. Industries with strong monopolistic power, government-owned firms, and principal-agent problems are particularly prone to X-inefficiency. By addressing these underlying causes, firms can enhance efficiency and lower costs, which can benefit both the firm and the broader economy.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInefficiency\nGovernment failure\nGovernment waste\nPareto efficiency\nProductive efficiency\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "iShares", "text": "iShares is a collection of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) managed by BlackRock, which acquired the brand and business from Barclays in 2009.  The first iShares ETFs were known as World Equity Benchmark Shares (WEBS) but have since been rebranded.Most iShares funds track a bond or stock market index, although some are actively managed. Stock exchanges listing iShares funds include the London Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, BATS Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Mexican Stock Exchange, Toronto Stock Exchange, Australian Securities Exchange, B3 (stock exchange) and a number of European and Asian stock exchanges.  iShares is the largest issuer of ETFs in the US and globally.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1993, State Street, in cooperation with American Stock Exchange, launched Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipts (NYSE Arca: SPY) (now the 'SPDR S&P 500'), which was traded in real time and tracked the S&P 500 index. This was the first ETF to trade in the United States, and it continues to trade to this day.In response, Morgan Stanley launched a series of ETFs called WEBS which tracked its MSCI foreign stock market indices. WEBS, an acronym for World Equity Benchmark Shares, were developed in cooperation with Barclays Global Investors, the fund manager. Unlike the SPDR fund that was a unit investment trust, the underlying vehicle of the WEBS were mutual funds.In 2000, Barclays put a significant strategic effort behind growing the ETF market, launching over 40 new funds, branded as iShares, supported by an extensive education and marketing effort. The effort was led by Lee Kranefuss, who worked closely with the inventor of the ETF, Nate Most, at that time Chairman of the WEBs Board and an adviser to Barclays on the iShares effort. Most had retired from the American Stock Exchange some years earlier and settled in California. WEBS were soon renamed the iShares MSCI Series as part of that program.On November 7, 2006, iShares announced the purchase of the INDEXCHANGE ETF unit of HypoVereinsbank for \u20ac240 million. This solidified the iShares position in Europe as the leading ETF provider.Barclays added currency hedging features to the Canadian iShares, to distinguish them from US products in response to the elimination of limits on foreign holdings by Canadians in an RRSP. Barclays hedges currency changes in the Canadian - US exchange rate for the S&P 500 and the MSCI EAFE.On March 16, 2009, Barclays confirmed that it was planning to sell iShares to CVC Capital Partners, a private equity firm that had agreed to pay more than $4 billion. However, under a 45-day \"go shop\" clause, a later bid by BlackRock was announced on 11 June 2009 for the whole of the parent division Barclays Global Investors including iShares, in a mixed cash-stock deal worth around US$13.5 billion (37.8 million shares of common stock and US$6.6 billion in cash).iShares has increased the number of its \"iShares Core\" funds.iShares is among the asset managers with the largest amount of sustainable fund flows in 2020 with $14.5 billion as of September 30, 2020.\n\n\n== See also ==\nETF Securities\nIPath\nList of exchange-traded funds\nPowerShares\nSPDR\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nOfficial website"}
{"title": "value investing", "text": "Value investing is an investment paradigm that  involves buying securities that appear underpriced by some form of fundamental analysis. The various forms of value investing derive from the investment philosophy first taught by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd at Columbia Business School in 1928, and subsequently developed in their 1934 text Security Analysis.\nThe early value opportunities identified by Graham and Dodd included stock in public companies trading at discounts to book value or tangible book value, those with high dividend yields, and those having low price-to-earning multiples, or low price-to-book ratios.\nHigh-profile proponents of value investing, including Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett, have argued that the essence of value investing is buying stocks at less than their intrinsic value. The discount of the market price to the intrinsic value is what Benjamin Graham called the \"margin of safety\". For 25 years, under the influence of Charlie Munger, Buffett expanded the value investing concept with a focus on \"finding an outstanding company at a sensible price\" rather than generic companies at a bargain price. Hedge fund manager Seth Klarman has described value investing as rooted in a rejection of the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH). While the EMH proposes that securities are accurately priced based on all available data, value investing proposes that some equities are not accurately priced.Graham never used the phrase value investing \u2013 the term was coined later to help describe his ideas and has resulted in significant misinterpretation of his principles, the foremost being that Graham simply recommended cheap stocks. The Heilbrunn Center at Columbia Business School is the current home of the Value Investing Program.\n\n\n== History ==\nWhile managing the endowment of King's College, Cambridge starting in the 1920s, economist John Maynard Keynes first attempted a strategy based on market timing, or predicting the movement of the finance market generally. When this method was unsuccessful, he turned to a strategy very similar to what would later be described as value investing. In 2017, Joel Tillinghast of Fidelity Investments wrote:\n\nInstead of using big-picture economics, Keynes increasingly focused on a small number of companies that he knew very well. Rather than chasing momentum, he bought undervalued stocks with generous dividends. [...] Most were small and midsize companies in dull or out of favor industries, such as mining and autos in the midst of the Great Depression. Despite his rough start [by timing markets], Keynes beat the market averages by 6 percent a year over more than two decades.Keynes used many similar terms and concepts as Graham and Dodd (e.g. an emphasis on the intrinsic value of equities). But a review of his archives at King's College found no evidence of contact between Keynes and his American counterparts so he is believed to have developed his investing theories independently, and did not teach his concepts in classes or seminars as did Graham and Dodd. While Keynes was long recognized as a superior investor, the full details of his investing theories were not widely known until decades after his 1946 death. Furthermore, while there was \"considerable overlap\" of Keynes's ideas with those of Graham and Dodd, their respective ideas were not entirely congruent.\n\n\n=== Benjamin Graham ===\nValue investing was established by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, both professors at Columbia Business School and teachers of many famous investors. In Graham's book The Intelligent Investor, he advocated the important concept of margin of safety \u2014 first introduced in Security Analysis, a 1934 book he co-authored with David Dodd \u2014 which calls for an approach to investing that is focused on purchasing equities at prices less than their intrinsic values. In terms of picking or screening stocks, he recommended purchasing firms which have steady profits, are trading at low prices to book value, have low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, and which have relatively low debt.\n\n\n=== Further evolution ===\nHowever, the concept of value (as well as \"book value\") has evolved significantly since the 1970s. Book value is most useful in industries where most assets are tangible. Intangible assets such as patents, brands, or goodwill are difficult to quantify, and may not survive the break-up of a company. When an industry is going through fast technological advancements, the value of its assets is not easily estimated. Sometimes, the production power of an asset can be significantly reduced due to competitive disruptive innovation and therefore its value can suffer permanent impairment. One good example of decreasing asset value is a personal computer. An example of where book value does not mean much is the service and retail sectors. One modern model of calculating value is the discounted cash flow model (DCF), where the value of an asset is the sum of its future cash flows, discounted back to the present.\n\n\n== Quantitative value investing ==\nQuantitative value investing, also known as Systematic value investing, is a form of value investing that analyzes fundamental data such as financial statement line items, economic data, and unstructured data in a rigorous and systematic manner. Practitioners often employ quantitative applications such as statistical / empirical finance or mathematical finance, behavioral finance, natural language processing, and machine learning.\nQuantitative investment analysis can trace its origin back to Security Analysis (book) by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd in which the authors advocated detailed analysis of objective financial metrics of specific stocks. Quantitative investing replaces much of the ad-hoc financial analysis used by human fundamental investment analysts with a systematic framework designed and programmed by a person but largely executed by a computer in order to avoid cognitive biases that lead to inferior investment decisions. In an interview, Benjamin Graham admitted that even by that time ad-hoc detailed financial analysis of single stocks was unlikely to produce good risk-adjusted returns. Instead, he advocated a rules-based approach focused on constructing a coherent portfolio based on a relatively limited set of objective fundamental financial factors.\nJoel Greenblatt's magic formula investing is a simple illustration of a quantitative value investing strategy. Many modern practitioners employ more sophisticated forms of quantitative analysis and evaluate numerous financial metrics as opposed to just two as in the \"magic formula\". James O'Shaughnessy's What Works on Wall Street is a classic guide to quantitative value investing, containing backtesting performance data of various quantitative value strategies and value factors based on compustat data from January 1927 until December 2009.\n\n\n== Value investing performance ==\n\n\n=== Performance of value strategies ===\nValue investing has proven to be a successful investment strategy. There are several ways to evaluate the success. One way is to examine the performance of simple value strategies, such as buying low PE ratio stocks, low price-to-cash-flow ratio stocks, or low price-to-book ratio stocks. Numerous academics have published studies investigating the effects of buying value stocks. These studies have consistently found that value stocks outperform growth stocks and the market as a whole, not necessarily over short periods but when tracked over long periods. A review of 26 years of data (1990 to 2015) from US markets found that the over-performance of value investing was more pronounced in stocks for smaller and mid-size companies than for larger companies and recommended a \"value tilt\" with greater emphasis on value than growth investing in personal portfolios.\n\n\n=== Performance of value investors ===\nSimply examining the performance of the best known value investors would not be instructive, because investors do not become well known unless they are successful. This introduces a selection bias. A better way to investigate the performance of a group of value investors was suggested by Warren Buffett, in his May 17, 1984 speech that was published as The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville. In this speech, Buffett examined the performance of those investors who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation and were thus most influenced by Benjamin Graham. Buffett's conclusion is identical to that of the academic research on simple value investing strategies\u2014value investing is, on average, successful in the long run.\nDuring about a 25-year period (1965\u201390), published research and articles in leading journals of the value ilk were few. Warren Buffett once commented, \"You couldn't advance in a finance department in this country unless you thought that the world was flat.\"\n\n\n== Well-known value investors ==\n\n\n=== The Graham-and-Dodd Disciples ===\n\n\n==== Ben Graham's Students ====\nBenjamin Graham is regarded by many to be the father of value investing. Along with David Dodd, he wrote Security Analysis, first published in 1934. The most lasting contribution of this book to the field of security analysis was to emphasize the quantifiable aspects of security analysis (such as the evaluations of earnings and book value) while minimizing the importance of more qualitative factors such as the quality of a company's management. Graham later wrote The Intelligent Investor, a book that brought value investing to individual investors. Aside from Buffett, many of Graham's other students, such as William J. Ruane, Irving Kahn, Walter Schloss, and Charles Brandes went on to become successful investors in their own right.\nIrving Kahn was one of Graham's teaching assistants at Columbia University in the 1930s. He was a close friend and confidant of Graham's for decades and made research contributions to Graham's texts Security Analysis, Storage and Stability, World Commodities and World Currencies and The Intelligent Investor. Kahn was a partner at various finance firms until 1978 when he and his sons, Thomas Graham Kahn and Alan Kahn, started the value investing firm, Kahn Brothers & Company. Irving Kahn remained chairman of the firm until his death at age 109.Walter Schloss was another Graham-and-Dodd disciple. Schloss never had a formal education. When he was 18, he started working as a runner on Wall Street. He then attended investment courses taught by Ben Graham at the New York Stock Exchange Institute, and eventually worked for Graham in the Graham-Newman Partnership. In 1955, he left Graham\u2019s company and set up his own investment firm, which he ran for nearly 50 years. Walter Schloss was one of the investors Warren Buffett profiled in his famous Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville article.\nChristopher H. Browne of Tweedy, Browne was well known for value investing. According to The Wall Street Journal, Tweedy, Browne was the favorite brokerage firm of Benjamin Graham during his lifetime; also, the Tweedy, Browne Value Fund and Global Value Fund have both beat market averages since their inception in 1993. In 2006, Christopher H. Browne wrote The Little Book of Value Investing in order to teach ordinary investors how to value invest.Peter Cundill was a well-known Canadian value investor who followed the Graham teachings. His flagship Cundill Value Fund allowed Canadian investors access to fund management according to the strict principles of Graham and Dodd. Warren Buffett had indicated that Cundill had the credentials he's looking for in a chief investment officer.\n\n\n==== Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger ====\nGraham's most famous student, however, is Warren Buffett, who ran successful investing partnerships before closing them in 1969 to focus on running Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett was a strong advocate of Graham's approach and strongly credits his success back to his teachings. Another disciple, Charlie Munger, who joined Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway in the 1970s and has since worked as Vice Chairman of the company, followed Graham's basic approach of buying assets below intrinsic value, but focused on companies with robust qualitative qualities, even if they weren't statistically cheap. This approach by Munger gradually influenced Buffett by reducing his emphasis on quantitatively cheap assets, and instead encouraged him to look for long-term sustainable competitive advantages in companies, even if they weren't quantitatively cheap relative to intrinsic value. Buffett is often quoted saying, \"It's better to buy a great company at a fair price, than a fair company at a great price.\"Buffett is a particularly skilled investor because of his temperament. He has a famous quote stating \"be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.\" In essence, he updated the teachings of Graham to fit a style of investing that prioritizes fundamentally good businesses over those that are deemed cheap by statistical measures. He is further known for a talk he gave titled the Super Investors of Graham and Doddsville. The talk was an outward appreciation for the fundamentals that Benjamin Graham instilled in him.\n\n\n==== Michael Burry ====\nDr. Michael Burry, the founder of Scion Capital, is another strong proponent of value investing. Burry is famous for being the first investor to recognize and profit from the impending subprime mortgage crisis, as portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie The Big Short. Burry has said on multiple occasions that his investment style is built upon Benjamin Graham and David Dodd\u2019s 1934 book Security Analysis: \"All my stock picking is 100% based on the concept of a margin of safety.\"\n\n\n==== Other Columbia Business School Value Investors ====\nColumbia Business School has played a significant role in shaping the principles of the Value Investor, with professors and students making their mark on history and on each other. Ben Graham\u2019s book, The Intelligent Investor, was Warren Buffett\u2019s bible and he referred to it as \"the greatest book on investing ever written.\u201d\nA young Warren Buffett studied under Ben Graham, took his course and worked for his small investment firm, Graham Newman, from 1954 to 1956.  Twenty years after Ben Graham, Roger Murray arrived and taught value investing to a young student named Mario Gabelli. \nAbout a decade or so later, Bruce Greenwald arrived and produced his own prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, including Paul Sonkin\u2014just as Ben Graham had Buffett as a prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and Roger Murray had Gabelli.\n\n\n=== Mutual Series and Franklin Templeton Disciples ===\nMutual Series has a well-known reputation of producing top value managers and analysts in this modern era.  This tradition stems from two individuals: Max Heine, founder of the well regarded value investment firm Mutual Shares fund in 1949 and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 legendary value investor Michael F. Price.  Mutual Series was sold to Franklin Templeton Investments in 1996.  The disciples of Heine and Price quietly practice value investing at some of the most successful investment firms in the country.  Franklin Templeton Investments takes its name from Sir John Templeton, another contrarian value oriented investor.\nSeth Klarman, a Mutual Series alum, is the founder and president of The Baupost Group, a Boston-based private investment partnership, and author of Margin of Safety, Risk Averse Investing Strategies for the Thoughtful Investor, which since has become a value investing classic.  Now out of print, Margin of Safety has sold on Amazon for $1,200 and eBay for $2,000.\n\n\n=== Other Value Investors ===\nLaurence Tisch, who led Loews Corporation with his brother, Robert Tisch, for more than half a century, also embraced value investing. Shortly after his death in 2003 at age 80, Fortune wrote, \"Larry Tisch was the ultimate value investor. He was a brilliant contrarian: He saw value where other investors didn't -- and he was usually right.\" By 2012, Loews Corporation, which continues to follow the principles of value investing, had revenues of $14.6 billion and assets of more than $75 billion.Michael Larson is the Chief Investment Officer of Cascade Investment, which is the investment vehicle for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Gates personal fortune. Cascade is a diversified investment shop established in 1994 by Gates and Larson. Larson graduated from Claremont McKenna College in 1980 and the Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago in 1981. Larson is a well known value investor but his specific investment and diversification strategies are not known. Larson has consistently outperformed the market since the establishment of Cascade and has rivaled or outperformed Berkshire Hathaway's returns as well as other funds based on the value investing strategy.\nMartin J. Whitman is another well-regarded value investor. His approach is called safe-and-cheap, which was hitherto referred to as financial-integrity approach. Martin Whitman focuses on acquiring common shares of companies with extremely strong financial position at a price reflecting meaningful discount to the estimated NAV of the company concerned. Whitman believes it is ill-advised for investors to pay much attention to the trend of macro-factors (like employment, movement of interest rate, GDP, etc.) because they are not as important and attempts to predict their movement are almost always futile. Whitman's letters to shareholders of his Third Avenue Value Fund (TAVF) are considered valuable resources \"for investors to pirate good ideas\" by Joel Greenblatt in his book on special-situation investment You Can Be a Stock Market Genius.Joel Greenblatt achieved annual returns at the hedge fund Gotham Capital of over 50% per year for 10 years from 1985 to 1995 before closing the fund and returning his investors' money. He is known for investing in special situations such as spin-offs, mergers, and divestitures.\nCharles de Vaulx and Jean-Marie Eveillard are well known global value managers.  For a time, these two were paired up at the First Eagle Funds, compiling an enviable track record of risk-adjusted outperformance.  For example, Morningstar designated them the 2001 \"International Stock Manager of the Year\" and de Vaulx earned second place from Morningstar for 2006.  Eveillard is known for his Bloomberg appearances where he insists that securities investors never use margin or leverage.  The point made is that margin should be considered the anathema of value investing, since a negative price move could prematurely force a sale.  In contrast, a value investor must be able and willing to be patient for the rest of the market to recognize and correct whatever pricing issue created the momentary value.  Eveillard correctly labels the use of margin or leverage as speculation, the opposite of value investing.\nOther notable value investors include:  Mason Hawkins, Thomas Forester, Whitney Tilson, Mohnish Pabrai, Li Lu, Guy Spier and Tom Gayner who manages the investment portfolio of Markel Insurance. San Francisco investing firm Dodge & Cox, founded in 1931 and with one of the oldest US mutual funds still in existence as of 2019, emphasizes value investing.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nValue stocks do not always beat growth stocks, as demonstrated in the late 1990s.  Moreover, when value stocks perform well, it may not mean that the market is inefficient, though it may imply that value stocks are simply riskier and thus require greater returns. Furthermore, Foye and Mramor (2016) find that country-specific factors have a strong influence on measures of value (such as the book-to-market ratio). This leads them to conclude that the reasons why value stocks outperform are country-specific.Also, one of the biggest criticisms of price centric value investing is that an emphasis on low prices (and recently depressed prices) regularly misleads retail investors; because fundamentally low (and recently depressed) prices often represent a fundamentally sound difference (or change) in a company's relative financial health. To that end, Warren Buffett has regularly emphasized that \"it's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than to buy a fair company at a wonderful price.\"\nIn 2000, Stanford accounting professor Joseph Piotroski developed the F-score, which discriminates higher potential members within a class of value candidates. The F-score aims to discover additional value from signals in a firm's series of annual financial statements, after initial screening of static measures like book-to-market value. The F-score formula inputs financial statements and awards points for meeting predetermined criteria. Piotroski retrospectively analyzed a class of high book-to-market stocks in the period 1976-1996, and demonstrated that high F-score selections increased returns by 7.5% annually versus the class as a whole.  The American Association of Individual Investors examined 56 screening methods in a retrospective analysis of the financial crisis of 2008, and found that only F-score produced positive results.\n\n\n=== Over-Simplification of Value ===\nThe term \"value investing\" causes confusion because it suggests that it is a distinct strategy, as opposed to something that all investors (including growth investors) should do. In a 1992 letter to shareholders, Warren Buffett said, \"We think the very term 'value investing' is redundant\". In other words, there is no such thing as \"non-value investing\" because putting your money into assets that you believe are overvalued would be better described as speculation, conspicuous consumption, etc., but not investing. Unfortunately, the term still exists, and therefore the quest for a distinct \"value investing\" strategy leads to over-simplification, both in practice and in theory.\nFirstly, various naive \"value investing\" schemes, promoted as simple, are grossly inaccurate because they completely ignore the value of growth, or even of earnings altogether. For example, many investors look only at dividend yield. Thus they would prefer a 5% dividend yield at a declining company over a modestly higher-priced company that earns twice as much, reinvests half of earnings to achieve 20% growth, pays out the rest in the form of buybacks (which is more tax efficient), and has huge cash reserves. These \"dividend investors\" tend to hit older companies with huge payrolls that are already highly indebted and behind technologically, and can least afford to deteriorate further. By consistently voting for increased debt, dividends, etc., these naive \"value investors\" (and the type of management they tend to appoint) serve to slow innovation, and to prevent the majority of the population from working at healthy businesses.\nFurthermore, the method of calculating the \"intrinsic value\" may not be well-defined. Some analysts believe that two investors can analyze the same information and reach different conclusions regarding the intrinsic value of the company, and that there is no systematic or standard way to value a stock. In other words, a value investing strategy can only be considered successful if it delivers excess returns after allowing for the risk involved, where risk may be defined in many different ways, including market risk, multi-factor models or idiosyncratic risk.\n\n\n== See also ==\nContrarian investing\nGrowth investing\nIndex investing\nInvestment style\nLow-volatility investing\nMagic Formula investing\nMomentum investing\nPiotroski F-score\nQuality investing\nValue (economics)\nValue averaging\nValue premium\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\n\nThe Most Important Thing Illuminated (2013), by Howard Marks\n\"Stocks and Exchange - the only Book you need\" (2021), by Ladis Konecny, ISBN 9783848220656"}
{"title": "land value tax", "text": "A land value tax (LVT) is a levy on the value of land without regard to buildings, personal property and other improvements upon it. It is also known as a location value tax, a point valuation tax, a site valuation tax, split rate tax, or a site-value rating.\nLand value taxes are generally favored by economists as they do not cause economic inefficiency, and reduce inequality. A land value tax is a progressive tax, in that the tax burden falls on land owners, because land ownership  is correlated with wealth and income. The land value tax has been referred to as \"the perfect tax\" and the economic efficiency of a land value tax has been accepted since the eighteenth century. Economists since Adam Smith and David Ricardo have advocated this tax because it does not hurt economic activity, and encourages development without subsidies.\nLVT is associated with Henry George, whose ideology became known as Georgism. George argued that taxing the land value is the most logical source of public revenue because the supply of land is fixed and because public infrastructure improvements would be reflected in (and thus paid for by) increased land values.Land value taxation is currently implemented throughout Denmark, Estonia, Lithuania, Russia, Singapore, and Taiwan; it has also been applied to lesser extents in parts of Australia, Mexico (Mexicali), and the United States (e.g., Pennsylvania).\n\n\n== Economic properties ==\n\n\n=== Efficiency ===\nMost taxes distort economic decisions and discourage beneficial economic activity. For example, property taxes discourage construction, maintenance, and repair because taxes increase with improvements. LVT is not based on how land is used. Because the supply of land is essentially fixed, land rents depend on what tenants are prepared to pay, rather than on landlord expenses. Thus, if landlords passed LVT on to tenants, they might move or rent smaller spaces before absorbing increased rent.The land's occupants benefit from improvements surrounding a site. Such improvements shift tenants' aggregate demand curve to the right (they will pay more). Landlords benefit from price competition among tenants; the only direct effect of LVT in this case is to reduce the amount of social benefit that is privately captured as land price by titleholders.\n\nLVT is said to be justified for economic reasons because it does not deter production, distort markets, or otherwise create deadweight loss. Land value tax can even have negative deadweight loss (social benefits), particularly when land use improves. Economist William Vickrey believed that: \"removing almost all business taxes, including property taxes on improvements, excepting only taxes reflecting the marginal social cost of public services rendered to specific activities, and replacing them with taxes on site values, would substantially improve the economic efficiency of the jurisdiction.\"\nLVT's efficiency has been observed in practice. Fred Foldvary stated that LVT discourages speculative land holding because the tax reflects changes in land value (up and down), encouraging landowners to develop or sell vacant/underused plots in high demand. Foldvary claimed that LVT increases investment in dilapidated inner city areas because improvements don't cause tax increases. This in turn reduces the incentive to build on remote sites and so reduces urban sprawl. For example, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania's LVT has operated since 1975. This policy was credited by mayor Stephen R. Reed with reducing the number of vacant downtown structures from around 4,200 in 1982 to fewer than 500.LVT is arguably an ecotax because it discourages the waste of prime locations, which are a finite resource. Many urban planners claim that LVT is an effective method to promote transit-oriented development.\n\n\n=== Real estate values ===\nThe value of land reflects the value it can provide over time. This value can be measured by the ground rent that a piece of land receives on the market. The present value of ground-rent is the basis for land prices. A land value tax (LVT) will reduce the ground rent received by the landlord, and thus will decrease the price of land, holding all else constant. The rent charged for land may also decrease as a result of efficiency gains if speculators stop hoarding unused land.Real estate bubbles direct savings towards rent seeking activities rather than other investments and can contribute to recessions. Advocates claim that LVT reduces the speculative element in land pricing, thereby leaving more money for productive capital investment.At sufficiently high levels, LVT would cause real estate prices to fall by taxing away land rents that would otherwise become 'capitalized' into the price of real estate. It also encourages landowners to sell or develop locations that they are not using. This might cause some landowners, especially pure landowners, to resist high land value tax rates. Landowners often possess significant political influence, which may help explain the limited spread of land value taxes so far.\n\n\n=== Tax incidence ===\nA land value tax has progressive tax effects, in that it is paid by the owners of valuable land who tend to be the rich, and since the amount of land is fixed, the tax burden cannot be passed on as higher rents or lower wages to tenants, consumers or workers.\n\n\n== Practical issues ==\nSeveral practical issues complicate LVT implementation. Most notably, it must be:\n\nCalculated fairly and accurately\nHigh enough to raise sufficient revenue without causing land abandonment, but if land is abandoned, it could be claimed by the State (as occurs under Israel's Absentees' Property Laws),\nBilled to the correct person or business entity\n\n\n=== Assessment/appraisal ===\n\nLevying an LVT requires an assessment and a title register. In a 1796 United States Supreme Court opinion, Justice William Paterson said that leaving the valuation process up to assessors would cause bureaucratic complexities, as well as non-uniform procedures. Murray Rothbard later raised similar concerns, claiming that no government can fairly assess value, which can only be determined by a free market.Compared to modern property tax assessments, land valuations involve fewer variables and have smoother gradients than valuations that include improvements. This is due to variation of building design and quality. Modern statistical techniques have improved the process; in the 1960s and 1970s, multivariate analysis was introduced as an assessment tool. Usually, such a valuation process begins with a measurement of the most and least valuable land within the taxation area. A few sites of intermediate value are then identified and used as \"landmark\" values. Other values are interpolated between the landmark values. The data is then collated in a database, \"smoothed\" and mapped using a geographic information system (GIS). Thus, even if the initial valuation is difficult, once the system is in use, successive valuations become easier.\n\n\n=== Revenue ===\n In the context of LVT as a single tax (replacing all other taxes), some have argued that LVT alone cannot raise enough tax revenue. However, the presence of other taxes can reduce land values and hence the revenue that can be raised from them. The Physiocrats argued that all other taxes ultimately come at the expense of land rental values. Most modern LVT systems function alongside other taxes and thus only reduce their impact without removing them. Land taxes that are higher than the rental surplus (the full land rent for that time period) would result in land abandonment.\n\n\n=== Title ===\nIn some countries, LVT is impractical because of uncertainty regarding land titles and tenure. For instance, a parcel of grazing land may be communally owned by village inhabitants and administered by village elders. The land in question would need to be held in a trust or similar body for taxation purposes. If the government cannot accurately define ownership boundaries and ascertain the proper owners, it cannot know from whom to collect the tax. Clear titles are absent in many developing countries. In African countries with imperfect land registration, boundaries may be poorly surveyed, and the owner can be unknown.\n\n\n== Incentives ==\n\n\n=== Speculation ===\n\nThe owner of a vacant lot in a thriving city must still pay a tax and would rationally perceive the property as a financial liability, encouraging them to put the land to use in order to cover the tax. LVT removes financial incentives to hold unused land solely for price appreciation, making more land available for productive uses. Land value tax creates an incentive to convert these sites to more intensive private uses or into public purposes.\n\n\n=== Incidence ===\nThe selling price of a good that is fixed in supply, such as land, does not change if it is taxed. By contrast, the price of manufactured goods can rise in response to increased taxes, because the higher cost reduces the number of units that suppliers are willing to sell at the original price. The price increase is how the maker passes along some part of the tax to consumers. However, if the revenue from LVT is used to reduce other taxes or to provide valuable public investment, it can cause land prices to rise as a result of higher productivity, by more than the amount that LVT removed.\nLand tax incidence rests completely upon landlords, although business sectors that provide services to landlords are indirectly impacted. In some economies, 80 percent of bank lending finances real estate, with a large portion of that for land. Reduced demand for land speculation might reduce the amount of circulating bank credit.\nWhile landowners are unlikely to be able to charge higher rents to compensate for LVT, removing other taxes may increase rents, as this may affect the demand for land.\n\n\n=== Land use ===\n\nAssuming constant demand, an increase in constructed space decreases the cost of improvements to land such as houses. Shifting property taxes from improvements to land encourages development. Infill of underutilized urban space is one common practice to reduce urban sprawl.\n\n\n=== Collection ===\nLVT is less vulnerable to tax evasion, since land cannot be concealed or moved overseas and titles are easily identified, as they are registered with the public. Land value assessments are usually considered public information, which is available upon request. Transparency reduces tax evasion.\n\n\n== Ethics ==\n\nLand acquires a scarcity value owing to the competing needs for space. The value of land generally owes nothing to the landowner and everything to the surroundings.\n\n\n=== Religion ===\nIt has been claimed that land is God's gift to mankind. For example, the Catholic Church asserts in its 1967 \"universal destination of goods\" principle:\n\nEveryone knows that the Fathers of the Church laid down the duty of the rich toward the poor in no uncertain terms. As St. Ambrose put it: \"You are not making a gift of what is yours to the poor man, but you are giving him back what is his. You have been appropriating things that are meant to be for the common use of everyone. The earth belongs to everyone, not to the rich.\"\nIn addition, the Church maintains that civil authorities have the right and duty to regulate the legitimate exercise of the right to ownership for the sake of the common good, including the right to tax.\n\n\n=== Equity ===\nLVT considers the effect on land value of location, and of improvements made to neighbouring land, such as proximity to roads and public works. LVT is the purest implementation of the public finance principle known as value capture.A public works project can increase land values and thus increase LVT revenues. Arguably, public improvements should be paid for by the landowners who benefit from them. Thus, LVT captures the land value of socially created wealth, allowing a reduction in tax on privately created (non-land) wealth.LVT generally is a progressive tax, with those of greater means paying more, in that land ownership correlates to income and landlords cannot shift the tax burden onto tenants. LVT generally reduces economic inequality, removes incentives to misuse real estate, and reduces the vulnerability of economies to property booms and crashes.\n\n\n== History ==\n\n\n=== Pre-modern ===\nThe philosophies and concepts underpinning land value taxation were discussed in ancient times, stemming from taxes on crop yield. For example, Rishis of ancient India claimed that land should be held in common, and that unfarmed land should produce the same tax as productive land. \"The earth ...is common to all beings enjoying the fruit of their own labour; it belongs...to all alike\"; therefore, \"there should be left some for everyone\". Apastamba said \"If any person holding land does not exert himself and hence bears no produce, he shall, if rich, be made to pay what ought to have been produced\".Mencius was a Chinese philosopher (around 300 BCE) who advocated for the elimination of taxes and tariffs, to be replaced by the public collection of urban land rent: \"In the market-places, charge land-rent, but don't tax the goods.\"During the Middle Ages, in the West, the first regular and permanent land tax system was based on a unit of land known as the hide. The hide was originally the amount of land sufficient to support a household. It later became subject to a land tax known as \"geld\".\n\n\n=== Physiocrats ===\nThe physiocrats were a group of economists who believed that the wealth of nations was derived solely from the value of land agriculture or land development. Before the Industrial Revolution, this was approximately correct. Physiocracy is one of the \"early modern\" schools of economics. Physiocrats called for the abolition of all existing taxes, completely free trade and a single tax on land. They did not distinguish between the intrinsic value of land and ground rent. Their theories originated in France and were most popular during the second half of the 18th century. The movement was particularly dominated by Anne Robert Jacques Turgot (1727\u20131781) and Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay (1694\u20131774). It influenced contemporary statesmen, such as Charles Alexandre de Calonne. The physiocrats were highly influential in the early history of land value taxation in the United States.\n\n\n=== Radical Movement ===\nA participant in the Radical Movement, Thomas Paine contended in his Agrarian Justice pamphlet that all citizens should be paid 15 pounds at age 21 \"as a compensation in part for the loss of his or her natural inheritance by the introduction of the system of landed property.\" \"Men did not make the earth. It is the value of the improvements only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property. Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for the land which he holds.\" This proposal was the origin of the citizen's dividend advocated by Geolibertarianism. Thomas Spence advocated a similar proposal except that the land rent would be distributed equally each year regardless of age.\n\n\n=== Classical economists ===\nAdam Smith, in his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations, first rigorously analyzed the effects of a land value tax, pointing out how it would not hurt economic activity, and how it would not raise contract rents.\n\nGround-rents are a still more proper subject of taxation than the rent of houses. A tax upon ground-rents would not raise the rents of houses. It would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent, who acts always as a monopolist, and exacts the greatest rent which can be got for the use of his ground. More or less can be got for it according as the competitors happen to be richer or poorer, or can afford to gratify their fancy for a particular spot of ground at a greater or smaller expense. In every country the greatest number of rich competitors is in the capital, and it is there accordingly that the highest ground-rents are always to be found. As the wealth of those competitors would in no respect be increased by a tax upon ground-rents, they would not probably be disposed to pay more for the use of the ground. Whether the tax was to be advanced by the inhabitant, or by the owner of the ground, would be of little importance. The more the inhabitant was obliged to pay for the tax, the less he would incline to pay for the ground; so that the final payment of the tax would fall altogether upon the owner of the ground-rent.\n\n\n=== Henry George ===\n\nHenry George (2 September 1839 \u2013 29 October 1897) was perhaps the most famous advocate of recovering land rents for public purposes. An American journalist, politician and political economist, he advocated a \"single tax\" on land that would eliminate the need for all other taxes. George first articulated the proposal in Our Land and Land Policy (1871). Later, in his best-selling work Progress and Poverty (1879), George argued that because the value of land depends on natural qualities combined with the economic activity of communities, including public investments, the economic rent of land was the best source of tax revenue. This book significantly influenced land taxation in the United States and other countries, including Denmark, which continues grundskyld ('ground duty') as a key component of its tax system. The philosophy that natural resource rents should be captured by society is now often known as Georgism. Its relevance to public finance is underpinned by the Henry George theorem.\n\n\n=== Meiji Restoration ===\nAfter the 1868 Meiji Restoration in Japan, land tax reform was undertaken. An LVT was implemented beginning in 1873. By 1880 initial problems with valuation and rural opposition had been overcome and rapid industrialisation began.\n\n\n=== Liberal and Labour Parties in the United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom, LVT was an important part of the platform of the Liberal Party during the early part of the twentieth century. David Lloyd George and H. H. Asquith proposed \"to free the land that from this very hour is shackled with the chains of feudalism.\" It was also advocated by Winston Churchill early in his career. The modern Liberal Party (not to be confused with the Liberal Democrats, who are the heir to the earlier Liberal Party and who offer some support for the idea) remains committed to a local form of LVT, as do the Green Party of England and Wales and the Scottish Greens.The 1931 Labour budget included an LVT, but before it came into force it was repealed by the Conservative-dominated national government that followed.An attempt at introducing LVT in the administrative County of London was made by the local authority under the leadership of Herbert Morrison in the 1938\u20131939 Parliament, called the London Rating (Site Values) Bill. Although it failed, it detailed legislation for the implementation of a system of LVT using annual value assessment.After 1945, the Labour Party adopted the policy, against substantial opposition, of collecting \"development value\": the increase in land price arising from planning consent. This was one of the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, but it was repealed when the Labour government lost power in 1951.\nSenior Labour figures in recent times have advocated an LVT, notably Andy Burnham in his 2010 leadership campaign, former Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn, and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.\n\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nThe Republic of China was one of the first jurisdictions to implement an LVT, specified in its constitution. Sun Yat-Sen would learn about LVT from the Kiautschou Bay concession, which had successful implementation of LVT, bringing increased wealth and financial stability to the colony. The Republic of China would go on to implement LVT in farms at first, later implementing it in the urban areas due to its success.\n\n\n=== Modern economists ===\nAlfred Marshall argued in favour of a \"fresh air rate\", a tax to be charged to urban landowners and levied on that value of urban land that is caused by the concentration of population. That general rate should have to be spent on breaking out small green spots in the midst of dense industrial districts, and on the preservation of large green areas between different towns and between different suburbs which are tending to coalesce. This idea influenced Marshall's pupil Arthur Pigou's ideas on taxing negative externalities.Pigou wrote an essay supporting LVT, interpreted as support for Lloyd George's People's Budget.Paul Samuelson supported LVT. \"Our ideal society finds it essential to put a rent on land as a way of maximizing the total consumption available to the society. ...Pure land rent is in the nature of a 'surplus' which can be taxed heavily without distorting production incentives or efficiency. A land value tax can be called 'the useful tax on measured land surplus'.\"\nMilton Friedman stated: \"There's a sense in which all taxes are antagonistic to free enterprise \u2013 and yet we need taxes. ...So the question is, which are the least bad taxes? In my opinion the least bad tax is the property tax on the unimproved value of land, the Henry George argument of many, many years ago.\"Michael Hudson is a proponent for taxing rent, especially land rent. \".... politically, taxing economic rent has become the b\u00eate noire of neoliberal globalism. It is what property owners and rentiers fear most of all, as land, subsoil resources and natural monopolies far exceed industrial capital in magnitude. What appears in the statistics at first glance as 'profit' turns out upon examination to be Ricardian or 'economic' rent.\"\nPaul Krugman agreed that LVT is efficient, however he disputed whether it should be considered a single tax, as he believed it would not be enough alone, excluding taxes on natural resource rents and other Georgist taxes, to fund a welfare state. \"Believe it or not, urban economics models actually do suggest that Georgist taxation would be the right approach at least to finance city growth. But I would just say: I don't think you can raise nearly enough money to run a modern welfare state by taxing land [only].\"Joseph Stiglitz, articulating the Henry George theorem wrote that, \"Not only was Henry George correct that a tax on land is nondistortionary, but in an equalitarian society ... tax on land raises just enough revenue to finance the (optimally chosen) level of government expenditure.\"Rick Falkvinge proposed a \"simplified taxless state\" where the state owns all the land it can defend from other states and leases this land to people at market rates.Fred Foldvary, an Austrian economist, has expressed support for the LVT and has integrated Georgist and Austrian models into his theory of the business cycle. \"Conventional macroeconomics lacks a warranted explanation of the major business cycle, while the Austrian and geo-economic Georgist schools have incomplete theories. A geo-Austrian synthesis, in contrast, provides a potent theory consistent with historical cycles and with explanations about the root causes.\"\n\n\n== Implementation ==\n\n\n=== Australia ===\nLand taxes in Australia are levied by the states. The exemption thresholds vary, as do tax rates and other rules.\nIn New South Wales, the state land tax exempts farmland and principal residences and there is a tax threshold. Determination of land value for tax purposes is the responsibility of the Valuer-General. In Victoria, the land tax threshold is $300,000 on the total value of all Victorian property owned by a person on 31 December of each year and taxed at a progressive rate. The principal residence, primary production land and land used by a charity are exempt from land tax. In Tasmania the threshold is $25,000 and the audit date is 1 July. Between $25,000 and $350,000 the tax rate is 0.55% and over $350,000 it is 1.5%. In Queensland, the threshold for individuals is $600,000 and $350,000 for other entities, and the audit date is 30 June. In South Australia the threshold is $332,000 and taxed at a progressive rate, the audit date is 30 June.By revenue, property taxes represent 4.5% of total taxation in Australia. A government report in 1986 for Brisbane, Queensland advocated an LVT.\nThe Henry Tax Review of 2010 commissioned by the federal government recommended that state governments replace stamp duty with LVT. The review proposed multiple marginal rates and that most agricultural land would be in the lowest band with a rate of zero. The Australian Capital Territory moved to adopt this system and planned to reduce stamp duty by 5% and raise land tax by 5% for each of twenty years.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nLVT were common in Western Canada at the turn of the twentieth century. In Vancouver LVT became the sole form of municipal taxation in 1910 under the leadership of mayor, Louis D. Taylor. Gary B. Nixon (2000) stated that the rate never exceeded 2% of land value, too low to prevent the speculation that led directly to the 1913 real estate crash. All Canadian provinces later taxed improvements.\n\n\n=== Estonia ===\nEstonia levies an LVT to fund municipalities. It is a state level tax, but 100% of the revenue funds Local Councils. The rate is set by the Local Council within the limits of 0.1\u20132.5%. It is one of the most important sources of funding for municipalities. LVT is levied on the value of the land only. Few exemptions are available and even public institutions are subject to it. Church sites are exempt, but other land held by religious institutions is not. The tax has contributed to a high rate (~90%) of owner-occupied residences within Estonia, compared to a rate of 67.4% in the United States.\n\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nGovernment rent in Hong Kong, formerly the crown rent, is levied in addition to Rates. Properties located in the New Territories (including New Kowloon) or located in the rest of the territory and whose land grant was recorded after 27 May 1985, pay 3% of the rateable rental value.\n\n\n=== Hungary ===\nMunicipal governments in Hungary levy an LVT based on the area or the land's adjusted market value. The maximum rate is 3% of the adjusted market value.\n\n\n=== Kenya ===\nKenya's LVT history dates to at least 1972, shortly after it achieved independence. Local governments must tax land value but are required to seek approval from the central government for rates that exceed 4 percent. Buildings were not taxed in Kenya as of 2000. The central government is legally required to pay municipalities for the value of land it occupies. Kelly claimed that possibly as a result of this land reform, Kenya became the only stable country in its region. As of late 2014, the city of Nairobi still taxed only land values, although a tax on improvements had been proposed.\n\n\n=== Mexico ===\nThe capital city of Baja California, Mexicali, has had an LVT since the 1990s when it became the first locality in Mexico to implement such a tax.\n\n\n=== Namibia ===\nA land value taxation on rural land was introduced in Namibia, with the primary intention of improving land use.\n\n\n=== Russia ===\nIn 1990, several economists wrote to then President Mikhail Gorbachev suggesting that Russia adopt LVT. Currently, Russia has an LVT of 0.3% on residential, agricultural and utilities lands as well as a 1.5% tax for other types of land.\n\n\n=== Singapore ===\nSingapore owns the majority of its land which it leases for 99-year terms. In addition, Singapore taxes development uplift at around 70%. These two sources of revenue fund most of Singapore's new infrastructure.\n\n\n=== South Korea ===\nSouth Korea has an aggregate land tax that is levied annually based on an individual's landholding value across the whole country. Speculative and residential land has a progressive tax rate of 0.2\u20135%, commercial and building sites 0.3\u20132%, farm and forest lands 0.1% and luxury properties 5%.\n\n\n=== Spain ===\n\n\n=== Taiwan ===\nAs of 2010, land value taxes and land value increment taxes accounted for 8.4% of total government revenue in Taiwan.\n\n\n=== Thailand ===\nThe Thai government introduced the Land and Building Tax Act B.E. 2562 in March 2019, which came into effect on 1 January 2020. It sets a maximum tax rate of 1.2% on commercial and vacant land, 0.3% for residential land and 0.15% for agricultural land.\n\n\n=== United States ===\n\nIn the late 19th century George's followers founded a single tax colony at Fairhope, Alabama. Although the colony, now a nonprofit corporation, still holds land in the area and collects a relatively small ground rent, the land is subject to state and local property taxes.Common property taxes include land value, which usually has a separate assessment. Thus, land value taxation already exists in many jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions have attempted to rely more heavily on it. In Pennsylvania certain cities raised the tax on land value while reducing the tax on improvement/building/structure values. For example, the city of Altoona adopted a property tax that solely taxes land value in 2002 but repealed the tax in 2016. Many Pennsylvania cities use a split-rate tax, which taxes the value of land at a higher rate than the value of buildings.\n\n\n=== Countries with active discussion ===\n\n\n==== China ====\nChina's Real Rights Law contains provisions founded on LVT analysis.\n\n\n==== Ireland ====\nIn 2010 the government of Ireland announced that it would introduce an LVT, beginning in 2013. Following a 2011 change in government, a property tax was introduced instead.\n\n\n==== New Zealand ====\nAfter decades of a modest LVT, New Zealand abolished it in 1990. Discussions continue as to whether or not to bring it back. Earlier Georgist politicians included Patrick O'Regan and Tom Paul (who was Vice-President of the New Zealand Land Values League).\n\n\n==== United Kingdom ====\nIn September 1908, Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George instructed McKenna, the First Lord of the Admiralty, to build more Dreadnoughts. The ships were to be financed by an LVT. Lloyd George believed that relating national defence to land tax would both provoke the opposition of the House of Lords and rally the people round a simple emotive issue. The Lords, composed of wealthy landowners, rejected the Budget in November 1909, leading to a constitutional crisis.LVT was on the UK statute books briefly in 1931, introduced by Philip Snowden's 1931 budget, strongly supported by prominent LVT campaigner Andrew MacLaren MP. MacLaren lost his seat at the next election (1931) and the act was repealed, MacLaren tried again with a private member's bill in 1937; it was rejected 141 to 118.Labour Land Campaign advocates within the Labour Party and the broader labour movement for \"a more equitable distribution of the Land Values that are created by the whole community\" through LVT. Its membership includes members of the British Labour Party, Trade Unions and Cooperatives and individuals. The Liberal Democrats' ALTER (Action for Land Taxation and Economic Reform) aims:\n\nto improve the understanding of and support for Land Value Taxation amongst members of the Liberal Democrats; to encourage all Liberal Democrats to promote and campaign for this policy as part of a more sustainable and just resource based economic system in which no one is enslaved by poverty; and to cooperate with other bodies, both inside and outside the Liberal Democrat Party, who share these objectives.\nThe Green Party \"favour moving to a system of Land Value Tax, where the level of taxation depends on the rental value of the land concerned.\"A course in \"Economics with Justice\" with a strong foundation in LVT are offered at the School of Economic Science, which was founded by Andrew MacLaren MP and has historical links with the Henry George Foundation.\n\n\n===== Scotland =====\nIn February 1998, the Scottish Office of the British Government launched a public consultation process on land reform. A survey of the public response found that: \"excluding the responses of the lairds and their agents, reckoned as likely prejudiced against the measure, 20% of all responses favoured the land tax\" (12% in grand total, without the exclusions). The government responded by announcing \"a comprehensive economic evaluation of the possible impact of moving to a land value taxation basis\". However, no measure was adopted.In 2000 the Parliament's Local Government Committee's inquiry into local government finance explicitly included LVT, but the final report omitted any mention.In 2003 the Scottish Parliament passed a resolution: \"That the Parliament notes recent studies by the Scottish Executive and is interested in building on them by considering and investigating the contribution that land value taxation could make to the cultural, economic, environmental and democratic renaissance of Scotland.\"In 2004 a letter of support was sent from members of the Scottish Parliament to the organisers and delegates of the IU's 24th international conference\u2014including members of the Scottish Greens, the Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish National Party.The policy was considered in the 2006 Scottish Local Government Finance Review whose 2007 Report concluded that \"although land value taxation meets a number of our criteria, we question whether the public would accept the upheaval involved in radical reform of this nature, unless they could clearly understand the nature of the change and the benefits involved.... We considered at length the many positive features of a land value tax which are consistent with our recommended local property tax [LPT], particularly its progressive nature.\" However, \"[h]aving considered both rateable value and land value as the basis for taxation, we concur with Layfield (UK Committee of Inquiry, 1976) who recommended that any local property tax should be based on capital values.\"In 2009, Glasgow City Council resolved to introduce LVT by saying \"the idea could become the blueprint for Scotland's future local taxation\". The Council agreed to a \"long term move to a local property tax / land value tax hybrid tax\". Its Local Taxation Working Group stated that simple [non-hybrid] land value taxation should itself \"not be discounted as an option for local taxation reform: it potentially holds many benefits and addresses many existing concerns\".\n\n\n=== Zimbabwe ===\nIn Zimbabwe, government coalition partners the Movement for Democratic Change adopted LVT.\n\n\n=== Belgium ===\nBernard Clerfayt called for the overhaul of the property tax in the Brussels region, with a higher tax for land values than for buildings.\n\n\n== Tax rates ==\n\n\n=== EU countries ===\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== Sources ===\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nSomerset Webb, Merryn (27 September 2013). \"How a levy based on location values could be the perfect tax\".

{"title": "use tax", "text": "A use tax is a type of tax levied in the United States by numerous state governments. It is essentially the same as a sales tax but is applied not where a product or service was sold but where a merchant bought a product or service and then converted it for its own use, without having paid tax when it was initially purchased. Use taxes are functionally equivalent to sales taxes. They are typically levied upon the use, storage, enjoyment, or other consumption in the state of tangible personal property that has not been subjected to a sales tax.\n\n\n== Introduction ==\nUse tax is assessed upon tangible personal property and taxable services purchased by a resident or entity doing business in the taxing state upon the use, storage, enjoyment or consumption of the good or service, regardless of origin of the purchase. Use taxes are designed to discourage the purchase of products that are not subject to the sales tax within a taxing jurisdiction. Use tax may be applied to purchases from out-of-state vendors that are not required to collect tax on their sales within the state. The use tax imposes a compensating tax equal in amount to the sales tax that would have been imposed on the sale of the property, if the sale had occurred within the state's taxing jurisdiction.  The use tax is typically assessed at the same rate as the sales tax that would have been owed, and generally the taxability of the good or service does not vary. However, there are some instances where the sales tax rate and the use tax rate vary.\nFor example, a resident of Massachusetts, with a 6.25% \"sales and use tax\" on certain goods and services, purchases non-exempt goods or services in New Hampshire for use, storage or other consumption in Massachusetts. Under New Hampshire law, the New Hampshire vendor collects no sales taxes on the goods, but the Massachusetts purchaser/user must still pay 6.25% of the sales price directly to the Department of Revenue in Massachusetts as a use tax. If the same goods are purchased in a US state that does collect sales tax for such goods at time of purchase, whatever taxes were paid by the purchaser to that state can be deducted (as a tax credit) from the 6.25% owed for subsequent use, storage or consumption in Massachusetts. With few exceptions, no state's vendors will charge the native state's sales tax on goods shipped out of state, meaning all goods ordered from out-of-state are essentially free of sales tax. The purchaser is therefore required to declare and pay the use tax to his home state on these ordered goods.\nThe assessing jurisdiction may make the use tax payable annually, but some states require a monthly payment. For example, where a Vermont resident has not paid at least 6% sales tax on property brought in for use in the state, Vermont law requires filing a tax return (Form SU-452 and payment) by the 20th day of the month following non-exempt purchases to avoid a $50 late fee, a 5% penalty per month, to a maximum of 25%, plus statutory interest on the unpaid tax and penalties.\nThere are currently over 14,000 tax jurisdictions in the U.S. and many of these jurisdictions have varying taxability on services. Given the volume of jurisdictions, the source of the sale may also need to be examined, in order to appropriately apply and remit the tax. For instance, states may require use tax based upon the location in which the service was provided, while other states may require use tax based upon the location of \"benefit\". In traditional repair and maintenance type services, these locations will typically be one and the same, however with complex technology transactions, these locations are often different.\nIn most cases, this complexity is part of the underlying sales tax laws; but while a brick-and-mortar store has to deal with only the sales tax laws of its own location, remote sellers have to deal with the use tax laws of many jurisdictions\u2014up to every US state and locality that assesses them, if the company has a presence or \"nexus\" in every state (as large \"brick-and-mortar\" sellers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy do).\n\n\n== Self-assessment ==\nThe use tax, like the sales tax, is assessed upon the end consumer of the tangible property or service, but the difference is who calculates the tax and how it is accounted for. The sales tax is collected by the seller, who is acting as an agent of the state and thus remits the tax to the state on behalf of the end consumer. On the other hand, the use tax is self-assessed and remitted by the end consumer. From an entity's perspective, the shift from sales to use tax is the equivalent of shifting from an expense account (profit and loss statement implication) to a liability account (balance sheet implication).\nTo illustrate sales tax, if company XYZ, Inc. purchased $40 of office supplies from an in-state vendor that collected $10 of sales tax:\n\nTo illustrate use tax, if company XYZ, Inc. purchased $40 of office supplies from an out-of-state vendor that did not collect sales tax, use tax is self-assessed:\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau  reported in 2014, $271.3 billion dollars in sales and gross receipts were collected by the 45 states that collect sales and use taxes; 33 of the 45 states increased collections year over year. Sales and use taxes combined account for 32% of all taxes collected by all states, second only to personal income tax collections.\nThe states themselves maintain that use tax collections are the second leading cause of tax deficiencies under audit.\n\n\n== Enforcement ==\nIn 2007, 22 states, including New York, California, Ohio and Virginia have included an entry on their state individual income tax return for taxpayers to voluntarily calculate an amount for use tax liability. Taxpayers, however, have been reluctant to pay taxes to the state. A few of these states have tried another approach by pre-determining the tax liability owed by every taxpayer by a tax table based on the individual's adjusted gross income. For example, a Michigan taxpayer with $45,000 of income can use the state's use tax table to estimate his use tax liability as $36. However, use of this table is limited to purchases of less than $1,000 and may be challenged during an audit. For purchases over $1,000, the taxpayer must calculate the tax for each item and add this amount to the use tax from the table. States using this method have seen an increase in voluntary compliance over those states that have the taxpayers calculate the use tax themselves.\nAs the amount of e-commerce sales continues to rise ($34 billion for just the second quarter of 2008) states recognize that the key to collecting these taxes rests not only in educating the individual taxpayer but with coordinating their efforts with other states. Currently, there are 19 full member states and 3 associate member states that belong to the Streamlined Sales Tax Project (SSTP). The SSTP assists states in collection of sales and use tax by registering merchants who charge out-of-state consumers the appropriate state sales tax and remit the tax to the appropriate state through a certified service provider. SSTP has also been in the forefront of an effort to push Congress to amend the laws to make collection of sales tax less burdensome. In fact, in May 2013, the United States Senate passed a bill that would give the states authority to require sellers to collect sales tax on out-of-state sales.  The House of Representatives must still pass the bill and send it to the President of the United States before it becomes law.States may also work with adjacent states via interstate use tax agreements. These agreements allow states to exchange tax audit records from businesses that have shipped goods to out of state consumers. Reciprocal states will then use those records and send a tax bill including penalties and interest to the individual taxpayer.\nStates have also pursued their collection efforts through the court system. In 2007, a California appeals court ruled that Borders Online owed California sales tax for online purchases that the store failed to collect from 1998 to 1999 since customers were able to return merchandise bought on-line to Border's retail stores in California.\n\n\n== Exemptions ==\nExemptions are typically offered based upon the type of customer:\n\nResale - Resale certificates are the most commonly used of the sales tax exemption certificates. Sales taxes are applied to retail sales and so sales for the purpose of reselling are exempt to avoid double taxation. Reselling and wholesaling account for $844 billion of the American GDP, or 3.3%.\nManufacturing - Manufacturing exemption certificates generally apply to manufacturers of tangible personal property, industrial processors, and refineries that produce tangible personal property for sale at retail. Each state outlines specific equipment and/or consumables that are eligible for the exemption. Estimates show (as discussed further in the Statistics Section) that $2.08 trillion and 12.5% of GDP is associated with the manufacturing sector.\nAgricultural - Agricultural exemptions are generally applied to sales of tangible property that will be utilized in farming, raising livestock, and maintaining agricultural land. According to the US Department of Agriculture, $412.3 billion of GDP relates to agriculture, and $5.816 trillion of tangible assets are in use for agricultural purposes. Estimates derived from gross sales of sampled states with exemption certificates that were annualized and stratified show that $45 million of state reported gross sales are associated with the agriculture sector.\nGovernment - The federal government is exempt from sales and use taxes per federal statute. Additionally, many states (all except Arizona) exempt their state governments by state statute. Not all states require a certificate for government exemption. Estimates show that approximately $19 trillion gross sales are associated to federal and state governments, which ties to actual reported on GDP reporting.\nExempt Organizations - Exempt organizations are generally defined as they are in Internal Revenue Code \u00a7501(c). Additionally, many states require the Internal Revenue Code letter establishing the organization as exempt as a supplement to the exemption certificate. Estimates show that approximately $1.5 billion of gross sales are associated to exempt organizations.\nConstruction Contracting - Construction and/or Capital Improvements may also be exempt per state statute or regulation. There may be different treatment for new construction and capital improvements. Construction contractors may be exempt from paying sales tax upon purchasing but will be required to pay use tax upon incorporation into real property. Construction accounts for $520.3 billion of GDP.\nAircraft - Aircraft, aircraft parts, and aircraft labor are generally exempt because aircraft are used in multiple states. Air services accounts for $63.3 billion of GDP.Exemptions are also offered upon the usage of the property. For instance, the most common types of exemptions are for resellers, who purchase the goods to resell them so they are not the end consumer. Manufacturers are also exempt when they purchase goods that ultimately are incorporated into tangible personal property that is destined for the open market. Again, the manufacturer is not the ultimate consumer of the good. Several states also offer Direct Pay Permits, which are issued to manufacturers allowing them to purchase the goods intended for incorporation into tangible personal property. Such manufacturers may also use the same goods or parts for repair and maintenance of their existing products previously purchased by the end consumer. Thus, the burden of tax liability shifts from the seller of the goods to the manufacturer. The manufacturer will purchase all goods tax exempt with the Direct Pay Permit but is required to accrue and remit tax on goods that are taken from inventory (intended for incorporation into tangible personal property held for sale) and consumed by the manufacturer. That is done because the manufacturer has better visibility to the usage of its property and so is in a better position to determine if use tax should apply.\n\n\n=== Direct pay permits ===\nDirect pay permits are generally used by manufacturers that purchase tangible personal property for resale and their own use. They usually require the seller to exempt the purchases and pay use tax upon removal from inventory. Manufacturers will either use an exemption certificate or will rely on a state issued direct pay permit/agreement.\nA direct payment permit allows a business to purchase taxable goods and services without paying tax to the vendor and to remit the correct use tax directly to the DRS. That allows businesses the necessary time to determine how much tax to assess on their purchases.\n\n\n=== Burden of proof ===\nThe ultimate burden of responsibility to verify the validity of the exemption lies with the issuer of the certificate. That is, the reseller or manufacturer who provided the certificate to the seller has the burden of proof and the financial responsibility for the tax, penalties, and interest if the proof is not met. The seller, as a collection agent for the state, can be made liable for the uncollected taxes if the burden of proof is not met, as outlined by state law and/or regulation.\nThere are two principles of proof used by states:\nGood faith acceptance is defined as \"total absence of intention to seek unfair advantage or to defraud another party; honest intention to fulfill one's obligations; observance of reasonable standards of fair dealing.\" In practice, that translates to accepting a completed certificate that appears reasonable on its face. For example, reasonableness for a manufacturer of widgets would be the purchase of raw materials such as metals or plastics, tools, etc. The purchase of children's toys or clothing would be unreasonable for the same manufacturer of widgets.\nStrict liability acceptance is defined as \"Liability that does not depend on actual negligence or intent to harm, but that is based on the breach of an absolute duty to make something safe.\"   Then, the liability of the seller is relieved upon receipt of the certificate, the seller has no obligation to validate the statements made by the purchaser.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInterstate commerce clause\nTax exemption\nTax holiday\nTax-free shopping\nTaxing and Spending Clause, specifically Article I, Section 9, Clause 5\nQuill Corp. v.

{"title": "inheritance tax", "text": "International tax law distinguishes between an estate tax and an inheritance tax. An inheritance tax is a tax paid by a person who inherits money or property of a person who has died, whereas an estate tax is a levy on the estate (money and property) of a person who has died. However, this distinction is not always observed; for example, the UK's \"inheritance tax\" is a tax on the assets of the deceased, and strictly speaking is therefore an estate tax.\nFor historical reasons, the term death duty is still used colloquially (though not legally) in the UK and some Commonwealth countries. For political, statutory and other reasons, the term death tax is sometimes used to refer to estate tax in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nThere was a steep increase in the number of countries that implemented inheritance taxes throughout the 19th and early 20th century. From 1960 onwards, inheritance taxes declined in prevalence as numerous countries repealed theirs.\n\n\n== Varieties of inheritance and estate taxes ==\nBelgium, droits de succession or erfbelasting (Inheritance tax). Collected at the federal level but distributed to the regional level.In the 2018 huge set of reforms, considering inheritance taxes, was accepted on the federal level and thus many changes on the regional level were also made. A family home is since 2018 an exception from a tax in all regions if it is bequeathed to a direct-line family member, spouse, or cohabitant.\nBermuda: stamp duty\nBrazil: Imposto sobre Transmiss\u00e3o \"Causa Mortis\" e Doa\u00e7\u00e3o de Quaisquer Bens ou Direitos (Tax on Causa Mortis Transmission and as Donation of any Property and Rights).

In order properly to understand the present state of the English law it is necessary to describe briefly the state of affairs prior to the Finance Act 1894 \u2014 an act which effected a considerable change in the duties payable and in the mode of assessment of those duties.\nThe Succession Duty Act 1853 was the principal act that first imposed a succession duty in England. By that act a duty varying from 1% to 10% according to the degree of consanguinity between the predecessor and successor was imposed upon every succession which was defined as \"every past or future disposition of property by reason whereof any person has or shall become beneficially entitled to any property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this act, either immediately or after any interval, either certainly or contingently, and either originally or by way of substitutive limitation and every devolution by law of any beneficial interest in property, or the income thereof, upon the death of any person dying after the time appointed for the commencement of this act to any other person in possession or expectancy\". The property which is liable to pay the duty is in realty or leasehold estate in the UK and personalty\u2014not subject to legacy duty\u2014which the beneficiary claims by virtue of English, Scottish, or Irish law. Personalty in England bequeathed by a person domiciled abroad is not subject to succession duty. Successions of a husband or a wife, successions where the principal value is under \u00a3100, and individual successions under \u00a320, are exempt from duty. Leasehold property and personalty directed to be converted into real estate are liable to succession, not to legacy duty.\nSpecial provision is made for the collection of duty in the cases of joint tenants and where the successor is also the predecessor. The duty is a first charge on property, but if the property be parted with before the duty is paid the liability of the successor is transferred to the alienee. It is, therefore, usual in requisitions on title before conveyance, to demand for the protection of the purchaser the production of receipts for succession duty, as such receipts are an effectual protection notwithstanding any suppression or misstatement in the account on the footing of which the duty was assessed or any insufficiency of such assessment. The duty is by this act directed to be assessed as follows: on personal property, if the successor takes a limited estate, the duty is assessed on the principal value of the annuity or yearly income estimated according to the period during which he is entitled to receive the annuity or yearly income, and the duty is payable in four yearly installments free from interest. If the successor takes absolutely he pays in a lump-sum duty on the principal value. On real property the duty is payable in eight half-yearly installments without interest on the capital value of an annuity equal to the annual value of the property. Various minor changes were made. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 exempted personal estates under \u00a3300. The Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1888 charged an additional 1\u20442% on successions already paying 1% and an additional 11\u20442% on successions paying more than 1%. By the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1889, an additional duty of 1% called an estate duty was payable on successions over \u00a310,000.\nThe Finance Acts 1894 and 1909 effected large changes in the duties payable on death. As regards the succession duties they enacted that payment of the estate duties thereby created should include payment of the additional duties mentioned above. Estates under \u00a31,000 (\u00a32,000 in the case of widow or child of deceased) are exempted from payment of any succession duties. The succession duty payable under the Succession Duty Act 1853 was in all cases to be calculated according to the principal value of the property, i.e., its selling value, and though still payable by installments interest at 3% is chargeable. The additional succession duties are still payable in cases where the estate duty is not charged, but such cases are of small importance and in practice are not as a rule charged.\n\n\n== United States ==\n\nThe United States imposed a succession duty by the War Revenue Act of 1898 on all legacies or distributive shares of personal property exceeding $10,000 (worth $308,902 in 2020 dollars). This was a tax on the privilege of succession, and devises and land distributions of land were unaffected. The duty ran from 75 cents on the $100 to $5 on the $100, if the legacy or share in question did not exceed $25,000. On those over that value, the rate was multiplied 11 times on estates up to $100,000, twofold on those from $100,000 to $200,000, 21 times on those from $500,000 to a $1 million, and threefold for those exceeding a million. This statute was upheld as constitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court.\nMany of the states also impose succession duties, or transfer taxes; generally, however, on collateral and remote successions; sometimes progressive, according to the amount of the succession. The state duties generally touch real estate successions as well as those to personal property. If a citizen of state A owns registered bonds of a corporation chartered by state B, which he has put for safe keeping in a deposit vault in state C, his estate may thus have to pay four succession taxes, one to state A, to which he belongs and which, by legal fiction, is the seat of all his personal property; one to state B, for permitting the transfer of the bonds to the legatees on the books of the corporation; one to state C, for allowing them to be removed from the deposit vault for that purpose; and one to the United States.The different U.S. states all have other regulations regarding inheritance tax:\n\nLouisiana: abolished inheritance tax in 2008, for deaths occurring on or after 1 July 2004\nNew Hampshire: abolished state inheritance tax in 2003; abolished surcharge on federal estate tax in 2005\nUtah: abolished inheritance tax in 2005Some U.S. states impose inheritance or estate taxes (see inheritance tax at the state level):\n\nIndiana: abolished the state inheritance on December 31, 2012\nIowa: Inheritance is exempt if passed to a surviving spouse, parents, or grandparents, or to children, grandchildren, or other \"lineal\" descendants. Other recipients are subject to inheritance tax, with rates varying depending on the relationship of the recipient to the deceased.\nKentucky: The inheritance tax is a tax on a beneficiary's right to receive property from a decedent's estate. It is imposed as a percentage of the amount transferred to the beneficiary:\nTransfers to \"Class A\" relatives (spouses, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings) are exempt\nTransfers to \"Class B\" relatives (nieces, nephews, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, aunts, uncles, and great-grandchildren) are taxable\nTransfers to \"Class C\" recipients (all other persons) are taxable at a higher rate. Kentucky imposes an estate tax in addition to its inheritance tax.\nMaryland\nNebraska\nNew Jersey: New Jersey law puts inheritors into different groups, based on their family relationship to the deceased person:\nClass A beneficiaries are exempt from the inheritance tax. They includes the deceased person's spouse, domestic partner, or civil union partner parent, grandparent, child (biological, adopted, or mutually acknowledged), stepchild (but not stepgrandchild or great-stepgrandchild), grandchild or other lineal descendant of a child\nClass B was deleted when New Jersey law changed\nClass C includes the deceased person's: brother or sister, spouse or civil union partner of the deceased person's child, surviving spouse or civil union partner of the deceased person's child. The first $25,000 inherited by someone in Class C is not taxed. On amounts exceeding $25,000, the tax rates are: 11% on the next $1,075,000, 13% on the next $300,000, 14% on the next $300,000, and 16% for anything over $1,700,000\nClass D includes everyone else. There is no special exemption amount, and the applicable tax rates are: 15% on the first $700,000, and 16% on anything over $700,000\nClass E includes the State of New Jersey or any of its political subdivisions for public or charitable purposes, an educational institution, church, hospital, orphan asylum, public library, and other nonprofits. These beneficiaries are exempt from inheritance tax.\nOklahoma\nPennsylvania: Inheritance tax is a flat tax on the value of the decedent's taxable estate as of the date of death, less allowable funeral and administrative expenses and debts of the decedent. Pennsylvania does not allow the six-month-after-date-of-death alternate valuation method that is available at the federal level. Transfers to spouses are exempt; transfers to grandparents, parents, or lineal descendants are taxed at 4.5%. Transfers to siblings are taxed at 12%. Transfers to any other persons are taxed at 15%. Some assets are exempted, including life insurance proceeds. The inheritance tax is imposed on both residents and nonresidents who owned real estate and tangible personal property in Pennsylvania at the time of their death. The Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax Return (Form Rev-1500) must be filed within nine months of the date of death.\nTennessee\n\n\n== Inheritance tax in Spain ==\nImpuesto de sucesiones, in Spain, is the inheritance tax \"that you must pay for the transference of goods due to the decease of a person. When a person dies in Spain, the set of goods will pass to their successors (heirs or legatees), and is for this acquisition of goods, rights, and obligations for which this tax must be paid\". In Spain, the tax is regulated in Law 29/1987, of December 18, on Inheritance and Donation Tax by Royal Decree 1629/1991, of November 8, which approves the Tax Regulation on Inheritance and Donations.It is a progressive tax, from 7.65% to 34% not including bonuses or reductions. However, rebates or reductions are common in most of the autonomous communities, with several of them reducing the tax rate to 1%, sometimes even to 0% if the tax base does not exceed a certain minimum. The applicable rate also depends on the proximity of the recipient or heir, being lower the greater its proximity to the deceased or donor (descendants, spouse...). It is usually summarized with the donation tax, as many parents transfer their goods inter vivos to their heirs.\nFrom this tax, the Spanish state gets 2,360,932,000 euros (2019) which is a 17.3% of the total recollected by the autonomous communities.This tax can be partially deduced according to the blood proximity of the person who will inherit the goods. The amount to deduce vary considerably depending on the autonomous community, and the reduction on the amount to pay has a descendant character, according to the membership group:\nGroup I: Descendants, regardless of whether they are adopted or not, under 21 years.\nGroup II: Descendants and adopted over 21 years and spouses.\nGroup III: Siblings, uncles, and nephews.\nGroup IV:  Other people not included in the other groups. Cousins or not directly related people.History of the tax\nThere's a consensus that this tax is a direct heir of the vicesimal heredatum, created during the Emperor Augustus age, taxing heirlooms and legacies. In Rome this tax was considered a donation and it depended on if the subject who passes their goods to their heir was alive (inter vivos) or deceased (mortis causa). This tax disappeared during the Middle Ages and was again restored temporally with Charles the IV in 1798, and finally consolidated on 1829 with two rates depending on consanguinity 2% for spouses and 12% for the intestate until IV grade:.\nThis tax will be oscillating for almost two centuries between 1 and 15% depending on the proximity group until the 11th of June 1964, where acquisitions mortis causa will be drastically increased compared to the previous centuries. \n\nOn spouses and legitimate descendants (offspring), we will see tax rates between 3% and 21%.\nOn legitimate ascendants (parents) we will see tax rates between 5% and 26%.\nOn descendants and ascendants by affinity from 23% until 55%.\nOn collaterals of second degree (Brothers, grandparents, or grandsons) we see the tax rates ranging between 28% and 58%.\nFor collaterals of third degree (great-grandparents, great-grandchildren, uncles and nephews) the tax will be between 40 and 69%.\nAnd the highest rates to non-directly related people will range between 58% and 84%.It will then be eliminated temporarily in 1977 and restored in 1987 which will prevail until now. Here the reductions that you can make on the payment are specified according to the 4 Groups:\nGroup I: 15,956.87 euros + 3,990.72 euros for each year under 21. This quantity can not exceed the 47,858,59 euros.\nGroup II: 15,956.87\nGroup III: 7,993.46\nGroup IV: There will be no place for reduction.It is also presented a reduction of 47,858.59 euros for people who present a legal condition of handicapped over 35%. This deduction can increase up to 150,253.03 in handicaps over 65%.\nDecentralization on the Spanish autonomous communities\nYou can calculate the tax you must pay following the state law. However, in Spain the calculus of the amount you pay depends on the specific autonomous community where you have your tax residence. In this scenario you must pay a percentage of the amount you inherit plus a certain quantity according to the total quantity you inherit.\n\nThe only Autonomous community excluded are Navarra and the Basque Country because they have their own tax system, and they work independently from the other communities or the central state.\nThis tax is deducible in many ways related to the consanguinity of the person who inherits, to the handicap level, the number of properties, usage of this properties, possession of enterprises, condition of victim of gender violence or terrorism. There are a lot of causes that can reduce notably your amount to pay. Moreover, this amount and reductions vary enormously according to the Autonomous Community you reside. For example, in Galicia, direct relatives of the deceased person will be exempted to pay the inheritance tax until the amount to inherit doesn't arrive the million euros. While in Asturias if you inherit a 700,000 property, the person will pay around a 20% of the amount depending on the variables.\n\n\n== Other taxation applied to inheritance ==\nIn some jurisdictions, when assets are transferred by inheritance, any unrealized increase in asset value is subject to capital gains tax, payable immediately. This is the case in Canada, which has no inheritance tax.\nWhen a jurisdiction has both capital gains tax and inheritance tax, inheritances are generally exempt from capital gains tax.\nIn some jurisdictions, like Austria, death gives rise to the local equivalent of gift tax. This was the UK model before the Inheritance Tax in 1986 was introduced, when estates were charged to a form of gift tax called Capital Transfer Tax. Where a jurisdiction has both gift tax and inheritance tax, it is usual to exempt inheritances from gift tax. Also, it is common for inheritance taxes to share some features of gift taxes, by taxing some transfers which happen during the lifetime of the giver rather than on death. The UK, for example, subjects \"lifetime chargeable transfers\" (usually gifts to trusts) to inheritance tax.\n\n\n== Historical ==\n\n\n=== Ancient Rome ===\n\nNo inheritance tax was recorded for the Roman Republic, despite abundant evidence for testamentary law. The vicesima hereditatium (\"twentieth of inheritance\") was levied by Rome's first emperor, Augustus, in the last decade of his reign. The 5% tax applied only to inheritances received through a will, and close relatives were exempt from paying it, including the deceased's grandparents, parents, children, grandchildren, and siblings. The question of whether a spouse was exempt was complicated\u2014from the late Republic on, husbands and wives kept their own property scrupulously separate, since a Roman woman remained part of her birth family and not under the legal control of her husband. Roman social values on marital devotion probably exempted a spouse. Estates below a certain value were also exempt from the tax, according to one source, but other evidence indicates that this was only the case in the early years of Trajan's reign.Tax revenues went into a fund to pay military retirement benefits (aerarium militare), along with those from a new sales tax (centesima rerum venalium), a 1% tax on goods sold at auction. The inheritance tax is extensively documented in sources pertaining to Roman law, inscriptions, and papyri. It was one of three major indirect taxes levied on Roman citizens in the provinces of the Empire.\n\n\n== See also ==\nProperty tax\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n Quotations related to Inheritance tax at Wikiquote\nTax inheritance iran"}

{"title": "Petition mill", "text": "A petition mill is a fraud in which the perpetrator poses as a financial advisor, sometimes as a credit counselor or paralegal, filing hastily prepared bankruptcy documents in the name of victims who come to the advisor as clients.  The bankruptcy filing is often both incomplete and inappropriate for the victim's condition; and, often, the victim does not even realize that a bankruptcy has been filed.\n\n\n== Method and victims ==\nVictims are people in financial trouble who believe they are becoming clients of a professional operation.  The fraudster promises to make the foreclosures, evictions, repossessions, high interest rates on loans, and other debt problems go away.  The victim pays a large initial fee for the fraudster's services, and the fraudster usually has the victim sign blank documents.  Sometimes the victim is also told to make their usual payments directly to the fraudulent advisor instead of the real creditors, or to transfer their real estate to the fraudster.  The payments are stolen by the fraudster instead of being used to pay victims' debts, and real estate is often deeded in fractional shares to other victims unknowingly under bankruptcy, complicating ownership to make foreclosures even more difficult by having multiple (fraudulent) bankruptcies involved in the property.\nIn other petition mill schemes, the fraudster simply creates summary bankruptcy filings for the victim.  The victim is then told to file pro se in court and deny that anyone helped prepare the documents.\n\n\n== Warning signs ==\nAccording to the United States Trustee Manual, volume 5, chapter 5, the following are warning signs of a petition mill scheme:\n\nPro se bankruptcy petition where the debtor says no one assisted him/her, but the debtor is clearly unfamiliar with the bankruptcy system\nPro se petition filed despite the debtor denying filing bankruptcy\nDebtor failing to attend the section 341 meeting, where creditors and the United States Trustee first meet with the debtor\n\"Face sheet\" (suspiciously small) filing with a single creditor listed, usually the mortgagee or the landlord\nDebtor facing eviction, foreclosure, or repossession notice\nPattern of pro se debtors with identical paperwork form, style, and general content\nPattern of complaints from mortgagees or landlords\nDebtors or others being solicited by petition mills that stress stopping evictions, etc.\nComplaints by debtor that he/she has been making rent/mortgage/car payments to a third party (instead of to the original creditors)\nAdvertising in budget papers and using flyers to advertise bankruptcy and divorce assistance at a low, fixed fee\nImplications that attorneys are supervising or approving the service\nRequests for payment of filing fee in installments\nAssets or liabilities not scheduled (filed in proper format)\nFailure to properly fill out or file schedules\nUse of chapter 7 (complete liquidation) when chapter 13 (reorganization) is clearly feasible\n\n\n== See also ==\nCredit counseling\nFraudulent conveyance"}

{"title": "Maslowian portfolio theory", "text": "Maslowian portfolio theory (MaPT) creates a normative portfolio theory based on human needs as described by Abraham Maslow. It is in general agreement with behavioral portfolio theory, and is explained in Maslowian Portfolio Theory: An alternative formulation of the Behavioural Portfolio Theory, and was first observed in Behavioural Finance and Decision Making in Financial Markets.Maslowian portfolio theory is quite simple in its approach. It states that financial investments should follow human needs in the first place. All the rest is logic deduction. For each need level in Maslow's hierarchy of needs, some investment goals can be identified, and those are the constituents of the overall portfolio.\n\n\n== Comparison with behavioral portfolio theory ==\nBehavioral portfolio theory (BPT) as introduced by Statman and Sheffrin in 2001, is characterized by a portfolio that is fragmented. Unlike the rational theories, such as modern portfolio theory (Markowitz), where investors put all their assets in one portfolio, here investors have different portfolios for different goals. BPT starts from framing and hence concludes that portfolios are fragmented, and built up as layers. This indeed seems to be how humans construct portfolios. MaPT starts from the human needs as described by Maslow and uses these needs levels to create a portfolio theory.\nThe predicted portfolios in both BPT and MaPT are very similar:\n\nIn BPT: safety layer, corresponds to the physiological and safety needs in MaPT\nSpecific layer in BPT are the love needs and the esteem needs in MaPT\nShot at richness in BPT is the self-actualization level in MaPTOne will notice that the main differences between MaPT and BPT are that:\n\nMaPT is derived from human needs, so it is to some extent a normative theory. BPT is strictly a descriptive theory.\nMaPT generates from the start more levels and more specific language to interact with the investor; however, theoretically BPT allows for the same portfolios.\n\n\n== Portfolio optimization ==\nGenerally it seems that Roy's safety-first criterion is a good basis for portfolio selection, of course, including all generalizations developed later.\nHowever in later work the author emphasized the importance of using a coherent risk measure \n.\nThe problem with Roy's safety-first criterion is that it is equivalent to a Value at Risk optimization, which can lead to absurd results for returns that do not follow an elliptical distribution. A good alternative could be expected shortfall.\n\n\n== Justification of the Theory ==\nFor many centuries, investing was the exclusive domain of the very rich (who did not have to worry about subsistence nor about specific projects). With this backdrop, Markowitz formulated in 1952 his \u201cMean Variance Criterion\u201d, where money is the unique life goal. This is the foundation of \u201cthe investor\u2019s risk profile\u201d as today almost all advisors use. This Mean Variance theory concluded that all investments should be put in one optimal portfolio. The problem is that this is both impossible and meaningless (which is my optimal volatility, my unique time horizon, etc.).\nHowever after World War II, the investor\u2019s landscape dramatically changed and in a few decades more and more people not only could, but actually had to invest. Those people do have to worry about subsistence and real life-goals! This automatically leads to the notion that investing should start from human needs.\nAs Abraham Maslow described, human needs can each get focus at separate times and satisfaction of one need does not automatically lead to the cancellation of another need. This means that Maslow's description of human needs was the first description of the framing effect bias in human behaviour, this means that human needs are actually observed as in separate mental accounts (see mental accounting). Therefore must be addressed one by one and each in a separate mental account.\nIn 2001, Meir Statman and Hersh Shefrin, described that people have \u201cBehavioural Portfolios\u201d: not one optimized portfolio, but rather pockets of separate portfolios for separate goals.\nIn 2009, Philippe De Brouwer formulates his \u201cMaslowian Portfolio Theory\u201d. The idea is that for the average investor should keep a separate portfolio for each important life-goal. This created a new, normative theory that gave the justification to goal-based investing and on top of that provides a framework to use it in practice (so that no goals are forgotten and all goals are treated in a reasonable order).\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Tail risk parity", "text": "Tail risk parity is an extension of the risk parity concept that takes into account the behavior of the portfolio components during tail risk events. The goal of the tail risk parity approach is to protect investment portfolios at the times of economic crises and reduce the cost of such protection during normal market conditions. In the tail risk parity framework risk is defined as expected tail loss. The tail risk parity concept is similar to drawdown parity Traditional portfolio diversification relies on the correlations among assets and among asset classes, but these correlations are not constant. Because correlations among assets and asset classes increase during tail risk events and can go to 100%, TRP divides asset classes into buckets that behave differently under market stress conditions, while assets in each bucket behave similarly. During tail risk events asset prices can fall significantly creating deep portfolio drawdowns. Asset classes in each tail risk bucket fall simultaneously during tail risk events and diversification of capital within buckets does not work because periods of negative performance of portfolio components are overlapped. Diversification across tail risk buckets can provide benefits in the form of smaller portfolio drawdowns and reduce the need for tail risk protection.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinancial risk\nHedge fund\nRisk parity\nHoly grail distribution\nBlack swan theory\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Life insurance tax shelter", "text": "A life insurance tax shelter uses investments in insurance to protect income or assets from tax liabilities.  Life insurance proceeds are not taxable in many jurisdictions.  Since most other forms of income are taxable (such as capital gains, dividends and interest income), consumers are often advised to purchase life insurance policies to either offset future tax liabilities, or to shelter the growth of their investments from taxation. This insurance product is also known as Private placement life insurance.\n\n\n== Life insurance to cover future taxes ==\nIn those jurisdictions where life insurance proceeds are only tax-free at death, tax liabilities that come due at death are often offset by a policy of the same size.  Since the mathematics required to compare different strategies is quite complex, most consumers defer to an accountant or life insurance agent for advice.  However, there is often vast differences of opinion between these professionals, even given the same starting conditions.  This should not be surprising, given the huge future differences that even small variances in starting conditions can make.\nFor example, assume that an individual is likely to owe $100,000.00 in taxes at death.  If a permanent life insurance policy with a $100,000.00 death benefit costs $1,000 per year (remaining level for life), and the life expectancy of the person is 30 years, then the following events could occur:\n\nThe individual could die early.  In this case, it is unlikely that any alternative investment of the $1000 per year would have yielded the required $100,000.00 at death.\nThe individual could live much longer than expected. The individual could have built up a significant cash value within the policy, depending on investment selection. As such, the individual would have access to these cash values tax-free regardless of growth, provided it is set up properly.Since one normally does not know which of these will occur (see adverse selection) calculations must be based on expected life expectancies for people of similar gender, physical condition, and behaviour.\n\n\n== Life insurance to shelter investment growth and income ==\nIn an attempt to achieve the \"best of both worlds\" (protection in the case of early death, and additional tax-protected returns in the case of long life), life insurance policies were created containing investment accounts having preferential tax treatment. \nThis is most often done with a Variable universal life policy.

{"title": "Style drift", "text": "Style drift occurs when a mutual fund's actual and declared investment style differs. \nA mutual fund\u2019s declared investment style can be found in the fund prospectus which investors commonly rely upon to aid their investment decisions. For most investors, they assumed that mutual fund managers will invest according to the advertised guidelines, this is however, not the case for a fund with style drift. Style drift is commonplace in today\u2019s mutual fund industry, making no distinction between developed and developing markets according to studies in the United States by Brown and Goetzmann (1997) and in China as reported in Sina Finance.When style drift presents in mutual fund, the investment information about the fund becomes misleading. Given that in reality, style drift is generally undetected, the information asymmetry of investment information has important consequences for fund investors seeking to maximize fund returns. Researchers such as Brown, Harlow and Zhang (2012) demonstrate that deviated fund tends to become another fund product of different risk returns profile that is not aligned with investor\u2019s initial investment goal. This is supported by a most recent study by Chua and Tam (2020), researchers find that style drift behavior prevents fund managers from picking superior stocks to meet investors' expectation for fund performance. In the same study, Chua and Tam (2020), finds that fund managers have a tendency to use style drift to maximize compensation, which is a demonstration of agency problem in mutual fund industry.\n\n\n== Active portfolio and style investing ==\nIt is widely acknowledged that style drift is a common practice particularly by active mutual funds in the financial markets.\n \nWhile passive funds (often called \"index funds\") employ a buy and hold strategy often following an index, active funds take on an active investment approach by picking stocks that move in and out of the market.\n \nIt is therefore common for active funds to embrace different investment styles and consequently, investors of active mutual funds need to keep an eye on their fund's risks exposure since style drift can impact risk exposure.\nThe rise of funds\u2019 investment styles can be traced back to studies on market anomalies.\n \nResearchers here view that stock returns are driven by factors related to \u201csize\u201d.\n \nand \u201cvaluation\u201d \n \neffects other than a single factor exposure of market risk under the assumptions of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (\u201cCAPM\u201d) developed by Sharpe-Lintner-Mossin in the 1960s.\nThe findings that stocks have distinctive characteristics exist, resulted in the rise of investment style. This stock style, in turn, has prompted the creation of numerous style indexes to track various stock market segments, for example, Standard &Poor\u2019s (S&P) style indices 500 (S&P 500) to represent large-cap market, mid-cap market is represented by S&P mid-cap 400, small-cap market is represented by S&P small-cap 600, growth and value indices.Depending on a fund's investment objective, its fund manager must adopt various investment strategies (see Investment strategy) in its portfolio construction to add value to fund returns. Strategies can be categorized into:\n\ntechnical analysis \u2013 contrarian or momentum approach; and/or\nanomalies/stock attributes\u2014calendar effect, stock characteristics with respect to size, value or growth.It is an industry-wide practice that mutual funds are categorized into investment styles that reflect the investment objectives and the underlying strategy of funds. \nThe practice is brought about by a market anomaly in a financial market demonstrating that different investment styles have dissimilar risk and return characteristics that serves important implications on fund performance attribution and outcome.\n\n\n== Style drift definition and metrics ==\nStyle drift is often referred to as \u201cportfolio/style tilt\u201d,  \u201cstyle volatility\u201d, and \u201cstyle shifting\u201d by researchers and practitioners to broadly account for the divergence of a fund\u2019s actual investment style from its declared contractual investment strategy in the fund prospectus. To determine the investment style of an active fund, and subsequently to detect style drift, two methods are commonly used. They are:\n\nReturns-based style analysis\nHoldings-based style analysis\n\n\n=== Returns-based style analysis ===\nReturns-based approach is a simpler approach to determining the investment style of an active funds. It is done by regressing fund returns against the returns of a set of passive style indexes or some constructed portfolios. While returns-based method is a low-cost approach, it has a few disadvantages in respect of its measurement. Specifically, it is advantageous to use a returns-based style technique if investment style of a mutual fund is stable over time; the technique also assumes factor exposures are constant.\n\n\n=== Holdings-based style analysis ===\nIn contrast to returns-based technique, holdings-based approach better reflects the true investment style of an active fund but analysis requires more time and is more costly to execute. Essentially, holdings-based technique examines the actual stock characteristics in the portfolio holdings. Fund portfolio holdings offer knowledge on the characteristics of the stocks which needs be assessed individually. Example of these stock style attributes are size, value and growth dimensions.\n\n\n== Style drift on fund returns ==\nThe outcome of how an active mutual fund is managed is of great importance to fund investors. One of the key conclusions in the existing literature is that some funds perform worse than others due to larger portfolio risk exposure and higher trading costs which are found to be correlated with greater volatility in investment style. In another study by Chua and Tam (2020), fund managers engage in style drift are found to have weaker stock picking abilities. This risk taking through style drift can thus cause a possible loss of confidence in the fund market.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPortfolio (finance)\nAsset allocation\nInvestment style\nActive management\nActive risk\nFinancial risk management \u00a7 Investment management\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Marginal conditional stochastic dominance", "text": "In finance, marginal conditional stochastic dominance is a condition under which a portfolio can be improved in the eyes of all risk-averse investors by incrementally moving funds out of one asset (or one sub-group of the portfolio's assets) and into another.  Each risk-averse investor is assumed to maximize the expected value of an increasing, concave von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function. All such investors prefer portfolio B over portfolio A if the portfolio return of B is second-order stochastically dominant over that of A; roughly speaking this means that the density function of A's return can be formed from that of B's return by pushing some of the probability mass of B's return to the left (which is disliked by all increasing utility functions) and then spreading out some of the density mass (which is disliked by all concave utility functions).\nIf a portfolio A is marginally conditionally stochastically dominated by some incrementally different portfolio B, then it is said to be inefficient in the sense that it is not the optimal portfolio for anyone. Note that this context of portfolio optimization is not limited to situations in which mean-variance analysis applies.\nThe presence of marginal conditional stochastic dominance is sufficient, but not necessary, for a portfolio to be inefficient. This is because marginal conditional stochastic dominance only considers incremental portfolio changes involving two sub-groups of assets \u2014 one whose holdings are decreased and one whose holdings are increased. It is possible for an inefficient portfolio to not be second-order stochastically dominated by any such one-for-one shift of funds, and yet to by dominated by a shift of funds involving three or more sub-groups of assets.\n\n\n== Testing ==\nYitzhaki and Mayshar presented a linear programming-based approach to testing for portfolio inefficiency which works even when the necessary conditional of marginal conditional stochastic dominance is not met. Other similar tests have also been developed.\n\n\n== References =="}

Conversely, when the relative return is negative, the portfolio is said to underperform the benchmark.\nWithin passive portfolio management, the absolute value of the relative return is often called the tracking error, which is confusing since the tracking error is more generally defined as the standard deviation of the relative return.  Index funds are the financial products that use passively managed portfolios.\nMany investors use the relative return measure to evaluate the skill of the portfolio manager: if the relative return is positive, then the portfolio manager has skill.  However, the relative return measure by itself is not sufficient to quantify how much skill a portfolio manager has, since the measure does not take into account the amount of risk that the portfolio manager has taken.  Also, because investment returns are largely due to chance, a portfolio manager's historical performance is not a good indicator of skill. Funds that have historically out-performed the market, cannot be expected to outperform the market in future years.Juxtaposed with the relative return measure is the absolute return measure, which is used to describe the return of the investment portfolio itself.  In recent years, so-called absolute return strategies, that aim to always produce a positive absolute return regardless of the directions of financial market, have become popular.  Contrary to popular opinion, it is not true that the relative return cannot be measured in a meaningful sense for absolute return strategies.  After all, the neutral position of these portfolios is to be fully invested in cash without any other long or short positions.  Thus, the risk-free rate is an appropriate benchmark to use for measuring the relative return of absolute return strategies.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIndex fund\nEnhanced indexing\nReturn\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Dedicated portfolio theory", "text": "Dedicated portfolio theory, in finance, deals with the characteristics and features of a portfolio built to generate a predictable stream of future cash inflows. This is achieved by purchasing bonds and/or other fixed income securities (such as certificates of deposit) that can and usually are held to maturity to generate this predictable stream from the coupon interest and/or the repayment of the face value of each bond when it matures. The goal is for the stream of cash inflows to exactly match the timing (and dollars) of a predictable stream of cash outflows due to future liabilities. For this reason it is sometimes called cash matching, or liability-driven investing. Determining the least expensive collection of bonds in the right quantities with the right maturities to match the cash flows is an analytical challenge that requires some degree of mathematical sophistication. College level textbooks typically cover the idea of \u201cdedicated portfolios\u201d or \u201cdedicated bond portfolios\u201d in their chapters devoted to the uses of fixed income securities.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe most prolific author on dedicated portfolio theory, Martin L. Leibowitz, was the first to refer to dedicated portfolios as \u201ccash matching\u201d portfolios. He demonstrated how they are the simplest case of the technique known as bond portfolio immunization. In his sketch of its history, he traces the origin of immunization to Frederick R. Macaulay who first suggested the notion of \u201cduration\u201d for fixed income securities in 1938. Duration represents the average life of the coupon payments and redemption of a bond and links changes in interest rates to the volatility of a bond's value. One year later, J.R. Hicks independently developed a similar formulation referred to as the \u201caverage period.\u201d In 1942, T.C. Koopmans pointed out in a report that, by matching the duration of the bonds held in a portfolio to the duration of liabilities those bonds would fund, the effects of interest rate changes could be mitigated or nullified completely, i.e. immunized. In 1945, Paul Samuelson formulated essentially the same concept, calling it the \u201cweighted-average time period.\u201d None of these earliest researchers cited each other's work, suggesting each developed the concept independently. The work culminated in a 1952 paper by a British actuary, F. M. Redington.This body of work was largely ignored until 1971, when Lawrence Fisher and Roman Weil re-introduced immunization to the academic community in a journal article that followed a 1969 report written for the Center for Research in Securities Prices. Shortly thereafter, in 1972, I.T. Vanderhoof presented the concept to the American actuarial community. Academic papers on immunization, duration, and dedication began to appear in increasing numbers, as interest rates began to rise. As rates rose further and further above their long term averages, the financial investment industry began to pay attention, and their inquiries increasingly attracted the attention of academic researchers. Realizing that the high rates would allow them to lock in unprecedented rates of return, defined-benefit pension fund managers embraced the concepts. Goldman Sachs and other high level firms began to produce software to help bond portfolio managers apply the theory to their institutional sized portfolios. Most of the examples used in the literature typically utilized portfolios consisting of several hundred million dollars. In 1981, Leibowitz and Weinberger published a report on \u201ccontingent immunization\u201d discussing the blending of active management of bond portfolios with immunization to provide a floor on returns. Leibowitz also published a paper in two parts defining dedicated portfolios in 1986. One of the side benefits of the theoretical work and practical interest was the development of new fixed income instruments, such as zero-coupon bonds.\n\n\n== Example of a dedicated portfolio ==\nWhile most of the original work on dedicated portfolios was done for large institutional investors such as pension funds, the most recent applications have been in personal investing. This example is a couple who wants to retire this year (call it 20XY, such as 2018) and has already set aside cash to cover their expenses. Social security will supply some income, but the rest will have to come from their portfolio. They have accumulated a retirement portfolio worth $2,000,000 in addition to this year's expenses. Typically, retirement portfolios have a higher percentage of bonds in their portfolio than portfolios owned by younger people who are not yet approaching retirement. Probably the most common retirement portfolio would be a 60/40 stock/bond allocation compared to an 80/20 or 90/10 stock/bond allocation for younger investors. Following a common rule of thumb for retirement withdrawal rates to make a retirement portfolio last at least 30 years, they should withdraw no more than 5 percent from their portfolio next year ($100,000). They can increase it each year by the amount of the previous year's inflation. To be conservative, they will plan for an annual inflation rate of 3 percent (they may not spend it, but want the protection just in case). Table 1, lists the projected stream of withdrawals. These withdrawals represent the yearly \u201cincome\u201d the couple needs for living expenses over their first eight years of retirement. Note that the total cash flow needed over the entire eight years sums to $889,234.Table 2 shows series of bonds and CDs with staggered maturities whose coupon and principal payments will match the stream of income shown in the Target Cash Flows column in Table 1 (rates are fictitious for this example). The cash flow generated by the portfolio for the first year would be $100,380. This consists of the principal of the bond maturing on February 15 next year plus the coupon interest payments flowing from all the other bonds. The same would be true for the following year and every year thereafter. The total cash flows generated over the eight years sum to $889,350, compared to the target cash flow sum of $889,234, a difference of only $116. As with the first year, the cash flows are very close to the target cash flows needed for each year. The match cannot be perfect because bonds must usually be purchased in denominations of $1,000 (municipal bonds in denominations of $5,000). However, with the use of fairly sophisticated mathematical optimization techniques, correlations of 99 percent or better can usually be obtained. These techniques also determine which bonds to buy so as to minimize the cost of meeting the cash flows, which in this example is $747,325. Note that in this example, the bonds all mature on February 15, the middle of the first quarter. Other dates may be used, of course, such as the anniversary date of the portfolio's implementation.\nThis would be the initial dedicated portfolio for the couple. But they hopefully have a lifetime financial plan designed to last 30 or 40 years. Over time, that means the portfolio will need to be updated or rolled forward as each year passes to maintain the same 8-year time horizon. The time horizon could be extended by adding another bond with an 8-year maturity or the equivalent. Extending on a regular basis could therefore provide a perpetual series of 8-year horizons of protected income over the investor's entire lifetime and become the equivalent of a self-annuity. Whether the replenishment occurs every year automatically or only if other criteria are met would depend on the level of sophistication of the investor or advisor.\nThe 8 years of bonds can be thought of an \u201cincome portfolio\u201d because it is dedicated to providing a predictable steam of income for the next 8 years. The rest of the portfolio can be thought of as a \u201cgrowth portfolio\u201d because it would be dedicated to providing the growth needed to replenish the income portfolio. The growth portfolio would presumably be invested in equities to achieve sufficient growth.\nRecent research has sought to assess investment strategies designed from dedicated portfolio theory. Huxley, Burns, and Fletcher explored the tradeoffs in developing suitable growth portfolio strategies. Pfau compared the performance of dedicated portfolios against other common investment strategies for retirement. In all comparisons, the dedicated portfolio approach provided superior results.\nNote that the fixed income securities shown in the example are high quality, safe \u201cinvestment grade\u201d fixed income securities, CDs and government-sponsored agency bonds, all chosen to avoid the risk of default. United States Treasury bonds could also be used. But they have lower yields, meaning a portfolio of Treasuries to meet the same flows would cost more than CDs and agencies. Triple-A rated corporate bonds are another option and usually have higher yields, but are theoretically riskier than government-sponsored bonds. Also, triple-A rated corporate bonds have become scarce since the financial crisis of 2008 over the wide range of maturities needed for dedicated portfolios. Investors willing to take greater risks may use any quality of bond deemed acceptable in light of their higher yields, though safety would likely be of paramount importance for retirement.\nRecall that a secondary goal of dedicated portfolio theory is to select the bonds that will provide the requisite cash flows at the lowest possible cost, given requirements on the minimum quality of bonds to be considered (thus the need for calculation). In this fictitious example, the cost shown is $747,325 to purchase this initial set of bonds, excluding transaction costs and fees, but the actual cost would vary depending on yields, quality of bonds used, and length of the time horizon. It would also depend on the starting time for the cash flows. If this couple planned to retire in five years, they could defer the starting time to coincide with their retirement date. They would buy a dedicated portfolio whose first bond matured in five years, the second in six years, etc. Yields would likely be higher on these bonds because they are further out on the yield curve.\nNote that any of the bonds could be zero coupon bonds, meaning they do not pay any coupon interest. It would be easy to build a dedicated portfolio consisting entirely of zero coupon bonds, but their yields can often be lower than coupon bonds. Another problem with \u201czeros\u201d is that taxes must be paid each year on the increase in value of a zero-coupon bond (assuming it is held in a taxable account), even though no interest was actually received.\nReturning to our example, assume that this \u201cincome portfolio\u201d were actually purchased, and the balance of the funds were invested in a \u201cgrowth portfolio\u201d of equity mutual funds or similar types of faster growing investments. The initial asset allocation would become 37% bonds, 63% stocks (see Table 3).\n\n\n== Advantages ==\n1. Predictable cash flows. Because the dates and amounts of the coupon and redemption payments are known in advance, individual bonds held to maturity offer something few other financial investments can provide: predictability. Most bond funds cannot provide this certainty because they hold large volumes of many different bonds and typically trade them rather than holding them to maturity. Thus, they behave more like sluggish stock funds in terms of volatility.\n2. Avoidance or reduction of investment risks. A number of risks associated with owning bonds are avoided or mitigated by using a dedicated portfolio:\n\na. Market risk (or capital risk) is avoided because the bonds are held to maturity. The market price at which the bond could be sold at any point in time may rise or fall before it reaches maturity, but these fluctuations are irrelevant to the investor if the bonds are held until they are paid off at face value. Of course, an investor does have the flexibility to sell off the bonds at any time in case an emergency arises.b. Reinvestment risk is avoided because the interest and principal from the bonds are spent to fund the liabilities (such as the living expenses for the retiree) rather than being reinvested.c. Inflation risk is mitigated by building an anticipated inflation adjustment into the target cash flows \u2013 recall the 3 percent annual adjustment used in the example. If inflation averages more than 3 percent, then the investor\u2019s real income will fall; that is, it will not be sufficient to provide the same standard of living. This inflation risk can be avoided entirely if inflation indexed bonds such as TIPS are used to build the dedicated portfolio. These bonds pay coupon interest plus increase the principal by the rate of inflation from the previous year, then pay coupon interest on the inflated amount the next year. At redemption, they pay the full face value, plus the accumulated inflation.d. Default risk (or credit risk) is mitigated by using only high quality investment grade bonds similar to those shown in the example above. Investors who are willing to assume more risk can build dedicated portfolios with lower quality bonds, gambling that a sufficient number of them will pay off ultimately.e. Liquidity risk is mitigated because individual bonds can be sold if the need arises. This is a significant advantage compared to annuities, which are not tradable securities.3. Specificity. Because dedicated portfolios are designed to provide a specific stream of funds to match future target cash flows, those cash flows must be quite specific in terms of timing and amounts. This need for specificity forces anyone contemplating a dedicated portfolio investment strategy to put careful thought into developing a formal, lifetime financial plan, as opposed to merely relying on vague or hazy goals and hoping for the best. The resulting asset allocation is based explicitly on the plan, instead of a generic model portfolio. This, of course, is the essence of serious financial planning, and the result is a portfolio that is tailored to the specific needs of each investor.\n4. Asset Allocation. One of the shortcomings of Modern Portfolio Theory is that it provides only a general notion of how assets should be allocated among the major asset classes (stocks, bonds, and cash). It focuses on the tradeoff between return and volatility \u2013 that is, higher returns can be earned only by investments that fluctuate more rapidly and with greater intensity. Dedicated portfolio theory focuses explicitly on cash flows and time horizons. If done properly, it allocates to fixed income no more than the minimum funds necessary to generate the desired cash flows, and all other funds can be invested elsewhere, as demonstrated in the example above. Most investors find this to be a more intuitive explanation for why their assets are allocated the way they are.\n5. Passive Management. There are two primary modes of thought on portfolio management. Advocates of active management believe that better returns are achieved by trying to time the market and selecting hot stocks (in other words, trying to predict the future). Advocates of passive management believe that better returns are achieved by buying broad based mutual funds, such as index funds, and holding them. Most academic research suggests that passive management has, in fact, historically produced higher returns over the long run. Dedicated portfolios fall into the category of passive management because once bonds are purchased, they are held to maturity. If all remaining funds are invested in an index fund, then the entire portfolio could be regarded as 100 percent passive. (Index fund providers, such as Dimensional Fund Advisors and Vanguard can supply voluminous research results on the active/passive management debate.)\n\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nDedicated portfolios are not without disadvantages:\n\nThe primary disadvantage of dedicated portfolios is that they are not easy to construct. They require expertise in bonds and other fixed income securities. Not all bonds are suitable for dedicated portfolios. For instance, they cannot use callable bonds because a called bond will create an unpredicted cash inflow that will require reintegration with the stream of undisturbed cash flows.\nThey require a high level of expertise in the mathematics of optimization theory. To determine the right quantities for each maturity to match the cash flows at minimum cost requires a technique known as mathematical programming.\nThey require formal financial planning and specificity to develop the target cash flows for each year and determine an appropriate time horizon, which, in turn, require time, thought, and effort on the part of both the investor and the financial advisor.\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nHuxley, Steven and Burns, J.

{"title": "Strip financing", "text": "Strip financing is the repackaging of different types of obligations\u2014debt, preferred stock, common stock etc.\u2014into one security. The idea is to ease conflicts of interest and agency costs between the holders of the initial components, bond and stockholders. \nIn deals that are strip financed, returns to investors are generally derived from their equity positions (seen through how investors from time to time take losses on the debt components of the strip). Therefore, in a situation where a company is acquired through a strip-financed deal, and that company begins to default on loans, investors are more willing to renegotiate lending terms, thus avoiding the hold-up problem often seen in prior to and during bankruptcy. Also, repackaging can raise a securities' liquidity. One popular form developed in Canada was the Income Trust, which combined income from a high yield bond with a stock dividend.  Beginning in 2003 this concept was expanded to the U.S. when \"Income Deposit Securities\" (also known as Enhanced Income Securities) were first offered on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX).  These consist of a high yield bond and a class of common stock committed to pay a high dividend from free cash flows combined as a single unit.\n\n\n== See also ==\nSecuritization\nContingent value rights\nEarnout\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "German income approach", "text": "The German income approach (German: Ertragswertverfahren, abbr. EWV) is the standard approach used in Germany for the valuing of property that produces  a stream of future cash flows.\n\n\n== Basic principles and regulations ==\nThe EWV is one of three valuation methods codified by German legislation. The Vergleichswertverfahren (sales comparable approach) is mainly used to determine the value of owner-occupied buildings (single-family houses, condominiums) and land. The Sachwertverfahren (cost approach) is only used for special use properties that do not produce a measurable future cash flow. Subsequently, the EWV is used for the vast majority of appraisals.\nEven though the EWV is mostly consistent with international practice, there are some important differences:\n\nLand and improvements are treated separately. German Generally Accepted Valuation Principles (GAVP) assumes that the land can be used indefinitely, but that buildings have a limited lifespan; This coincides with the balancing of the assets. The value of the land is determined by the sales comparison approach in both the income and cost approaches, using the data accumulated by the Gutachterausschuss (local valuation committees, lit. \"expert committees\") which is then added to the building value.\nIn order to account for the usage of the land by the buildings occupying it, the net operating income is reduced by the Liegenschaftszins (interest paid to the land-owner by the owner of the building, i.e. ground rent). The Liegenschaftszins is the product of the land value and the Liegenschaftszinssatz (interest rate for land-use). The Liegenschaftszinssatz is the equivalent of the yield \u2212 with some important differences \u2212 and is determined by the Gutachterausschuss.\nUnlike the All Risks Yield (ARY) in UK practice, the Liegenschaftszinssatz (LZ) does not include an allowance for default (not to be confused with structural vacancy), and therefore this should be subtracted from gross operating income. As a result,  the Liegenschaftszinssatz will usually be lower than the All Risks Yield.\nBased on the assumption that the economic life of the improvements is limited, the yield and remaining economic life determine the building value through the net operating income.\nIt should be additionally  noted that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK.Real estate appraisal in Germany is regulated by the federal Baugesetzbuch (abbr. BauGB, the German statutory code of building and construction). This federal law is supported by the Wertermittlungsverordnung (abbr. WertV, \"regulation on the determination of value\"). The WertV defines the codified valuation approaches and the general valuation technique. WertV's general regulations are further supported by the Wertermittlungsrichtlinie (abbr. WertR, \"directive on the determination of value\"). The WertR provides templates for calculations, tables (e. g. economic depreciation) and guidelines for the consideration of different influences. WertV and WertR are not binding for appraisals for non-official use, nonetheless they should be regarded as best practice or German Professional Appraisal Practice (PAP).\n\n\n== Determination of value drivers ==\n\n\n=== Building condition  and useful life ===\nThe condition of the building has a direct effect on the valuation. First of all it has to be determined whether the building has a maintenance backlog. If so, the cost for resolving this backlog (usually referred to as capex) has to be calculated and will later on be subtracted from the value. This calculation has to be made under the assumption that it correlates with the assumed rental income and also has to take into effect the building's age. Secondly, major refurbishment or upgradings have to be taken into account, as they can extend the duration of the building's useful life.\nGerman literature and the semi-official Normalherstellungskosten 2000 (abbr. NHK 2000, \"Normal Production Costs\")  provide detailed information on the useful life span, which is generally judged to be 60\u201380 years for multiple dwellings and 50\u201380 years for office buildings. It must be stressed that the useful life span needs to be applied with due regard to the economic environment, whereas the technical life span may be indefinite. Towards the end of its useful life, the building's value is understood to decrease sharply, as either a new building or a major refurbishment will be necessary to generate rental income in the long run.\nTherefore a recent major refurbishment (outer shell, rentable areas, HVACR, etc.) can significantly increase the building's remaining useful life, depending on the scope of the refurbishment and assuming that other considerations such as layout and energy consumption do not confound the effort.\nContaminations of the building with asbestos or other harmful materials might also affect the total value; this is usually accounted for by subtracting the decontamination costs from the building's value.\n\n\n=== Land value ===\nIn order to separately determine the value of the land, an appraiser in Germany will usually will use the information gathered by the Gutachterausschuss (GA). Most GAs will publish market reports every two years, including Bodenrichtwertkarten (land value guide maps). It is also possible to directly contact the local GA and ask for land value data on a specific plot of land.\nThe following must be taken into account when utilising a given comparable: \n\nThe comparable must be nearby or, when referring to a land value zone, the subject of the valuation must be within or nearby the respective zone;\nThe type of use (residential, office, retail, industrial, etc.) should be in line with that of the subject of the valuation;\nThe degree of utilisation - measured in gross floor area or gross volume area - must be made comparable by use of appropriate conversion coefficients;\nThe size of the parcel of land must be taken into account.Further on the appraiser has to check if there are additional factors that will influence the land value. These might be site development costs, contamination, right-of-way or other rights etc. These have to be taken into account in an appropriate manner.\n\n\n=== Yield ===\nThe yield, which in German valuation practice is known as the Liegenschaftszinssatz, is a crucial value driver, as it will be used to determine the Liegenschaftszins (a notional rent subtracted from the building's net operating income in order to account for the usage of the economic good \"land\"). Moreover, together with the residual life span, it mathematically determines the multiplier that is used to calculate the building's value.\nAgain, the Gutachteraussch\u00fcsse will provide information on the yield. By empirical analysis of the purchase price data base, the GA stipulates the local yield by type of use. Alas, a widespread problem is that some GAs in smaller municipalities do not carry out these analyses and thus do not publish yield data. In that case the appraiser has to fall back on a combination of nationwide yield data, market research and experience.\nDuring the past few years, yields for residential assets (multiple dwellings) were usually within the range of four to five percent, depending on local market conditions. Yields for office buildings should mostly be in the range of five to six percent, while yields for retail and logistics buildings will be accordingly higher.\nThe determined basic yield (for type of usage and municipality) should always be analysed further, as under or above average liquidity, lay of the land or the floor plans, should be taken into account by way of a deduction or premium of 25 or 50 basis points for each respective factor.\n\n\n=== Gross income ===\nNeedless to say, the Rohertrag (gross income) is the most important value driver for real estate which produces future cash flows. The EWV is basically a static model, meaning that a sustainable income is treated as stable in the future. The appraiser will form his (or her) opinion on the basis of the existing leases, while also considering the market rent.\nIn commercial real estate such as office or retail buildings, the existing leases usually determine the sustainable income, as long as the lease contracts are long-term and the tenant has a good credit rating. If this is not the case, then the appraiser must rely on his or her knowledge of the market, as well as his experience regarding future lease contracts. Possible incentives must also be accounted for.\nIn contrast to commercial real estate, residential lease contracts are highly codified by the B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch (abbr. BGB, \"German civil code\"). One of the central ideas there regarding real estate, is the Orts\u00fcbliche Vergleichsmiete (local customary comparable rent). New leases must not be more than 20 percent (not exactly stated by BGB, depending on the jurisdiction) higher than the local customary comparable rent, or the rental contracts may be nullified. Within existing lease contracts, rent increases (i) must not exceed the local customary comparable rent, (ii) are only allowed for if the rent has not increased for the past 15 months, and (iii) must not exceed a total increase of 20 percent within three years. To conclude, the determination of the sustainable rent for residential assets should be made on conservative premises and in close correlation with the current rents. Experience shows that foreign investors have in the past tended to underestimate the effects of such legislation. \nThe sustainable rent, determined as described above, will be treated as stable and will form the basis of the irredeemable. However, it is possible to allow for over or under rents in the short run. The difference between this and the sustainable rent should be discounted and the resulting value should be added or subtracted to the building value (this approach is in some ways comparable to the hard core/layer method employed in UK practice).\nA special case is the existence of struktureller Leerstand (long-term or structural vacancy) resulting from an imbalance in the market or from unfavourable characteristics of the subject property. If this is the case, determination of the sustainable rent will not assume a fully rented property, but instead will allow for a certain level of permanent vacancy.\nAdditional income e.g. from mobile phone antennae must also be included in the gross income.\n\n\n=== Expenses ===\nGerman GAVP (especially the WertV) breaks down the Bewirtschaftungskosten (operating expenses) into four types. It should be observed that contracts in Germany generally prescribe that the landlord bears a higher portion of maintenance and operating costs than their counterparts in the US and UK\n\nThe Heiz-, Betriebs- und Nebenkosten (\"cost of heating and running costs\"): Depending on the respective lease contracts, in commercial properties all costs can be and usually are passed on to the tenant. This is different in residential assets, because the Betriebskostenverordnung (abbr. BetrKV, \"running costs regulation\") stipulates which costs can and which costs cannot be passed on. Whereas costs of water, heating, caretaker, etc. can be passed on (energy companies usually bill costs for electricity directly to the tenant), other costs such as property tax and insurance cannot be reimbursed. Therefore in appraisals for residential properties a certain amount (ranging from 20 to 50 Eurocent per square metre per month) should be allowed for.\nThe Verwaltungskosten (\"administrative costs\"): These can be passed on in commercial leases, but not in residential leases. Management costs usually range from two to five percent of the gross income for commercial properties and between 15 and 20 Euro per month per residential unit in residential properties. If the building is held in co-operative ownership, the administrative costs are significantly higher.\nThe Instandhaltungskosten (maintenance costs): In commercial leases these can be reimbursed, if the contract is formulated accordingly. Most contracts however leave the costs of maintenance of the outer shell to the owner. With residential real estate the owner has to allow for the maintenance costs. In order to determine the exact numbers, the appraisal should also take into consideration how high the fluctuation is and if cosmetic repairs are agreed upon. Standard projections for maintenance costs vary widely from four to 20 Euro per square meter per year.\nThe Mietausfallwagnis (allowance for rental loss): As described in the introduction, in German GAVP a rental loss (income from existing leases that is lost due to poor economic situation of the tenant) is allowed for as an expense. This might look strange in comparison to US or UK practice, but it has the advantage that the loss can be allowed for in quite a precise manner. It is usually calculated on the basis of existing numbers. In well-managed residential properties it should not be higher than two percent, in commercial properties three to four percent (depending on tenant structure).\n\n\n== Calculation procedures ==\nAfter the determination of the value drivers, the calculation procedure itself is rather simple.\n\n\n=== Calculation of the value of land ===\nThe value of the land is calculated by multiplying the land value (after adjustments) with the size of the land. Surplus land has to be looked at separately, as this is a special case. Potential decontamination costs or other effects influencing the value are taken into account by an appropriate premium or deduction.\n\n\n=== Calculation of the value of the building ===\nThe Jahresreinertrag (\"net annual operating income\" (NOI)) is determined by subtracting the yearly expenses from the gross income. In a next step, the notional ground rent is allowed for. This so-called Liegenschaftszins (\"rent for land use\") is determined by multiplying the land value with the yield (after adjustments). The resulting yearly sum is subtracted from the result of the previous step.\nIn order to transform the yearly NOI into the building value, the multiplier is mathematically (or by use of tables provided by the WertR) determined from the residual usage period and the yield (after adjustments). The product of the multiplier and the NOI determines the building value.\nThis building value can be adjusted by premiums or deductions for maintenance backlog, harmful material, over or under rent etc. The resulting figure is the adjusted value of the building.\n\n\n=== Consolidation ===\nThe addition of land value and building value (improvements) results in the property value. WertV article 19 offers the possibility of making final adjustments for any circumstances not taken into account in the previous steps. However, any additional adjustments should be explicitly stated.\n\n\n== Formal aspects ==\nA good appraisal report should be transparent and comprehensible. The determination of the value drivers should be well-documented and referenced, so that an expert reader may be able to quickly assess the report's quality.\nMost appraisal reports are structured as follows:\n\nIntroduction, date of valuation, customer and purpose of the valuation;\nDocumentation of land register and other legal factors;\nDescription of land and improvements;\nAnalysis of the market situation and rental contracts;\nDocumentation of the determination of value drivers;\nCalculation and value statement;\nAppendix with photo documentation.\n\n\n== Conclusion ==\nFrom a theoretical point of view, the German income approach contains some interesting specifics: Even though in the determination of gross rental income it is quite similar to the US income approach, in its apportionment of income between land and improvements, which allows for the building's limited useful life-span to be taken into account, it also contains elements of the discounted cash flow approach.\nGerman PAP generally advises to rely on existing numbers, but allows to fall back on empirical values and experience when needed.

{"title": "Generalized expected utility", "text": "Generalized expected utility is a decision-making metric based on any of a variety of theories that attempt to resolve some discrepancies between expected utility theory and empirical observations, concerning choice under risky (probabilistic) circumstances. Given its motivations and approach, generalized expected utility theory may properly be regarded as a subfield of behavioral economics, but it is more frequently located within mainstream economic theory.\nThe expected utility model developed by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern dominated decision theory from its formulation in 1944 until the late 1970s, not only as a prescriptive, but also as a descriptive model, despite powerful criticism from Maurice Allais and Daniel Ellsberg who showed that, in certain choice problems, decisions were usually inconsistent with the axioms of expected utility theory. These problems are usually referred to as the Allais paradox and Ellsberg paradox. \nBeginning in 1979 with the publication of the prospect theory of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, a range of generalized expected utility models were developed with the aim of resolving the Allais and Ellsberg paradoxes, while maintaining many of the attractive properties of expected utility theory. Important examples were anticipated utility theory, later referred to as rank-dependent utility theory, weighted utility (Chew 1982), and expected uncertain utility theory. A general representation, using the concept of the local utility function was presented by Mark J. Machina. Since then, generalizations of expected utility theory have proliferated, but the probably most frequently used model is nowadays cumulative prospect theory, a rank-dependent development of prospect theory, introduced in 1992 by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky.\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Over-investing", "text": "Over-investing in finance, particularly personal finance, refers to the practice of investing more into an asset than what that asset is worth on the open market. It is cited most frequently in reference to expensive personal consumable investments such as houses, automobiles, and trailers. \n\n\n== Example ==\nIf a homeowner makes additions or improvements to her house to the point that the owner has invested considerably more than the market value of other houses in that area, then she has likely over-invested in that house. The \"neighbourhood effect\" will serve to devalue the house so that it is worth less than what has been invested in it. Another example is a person who buys a used car for $2000, spends another $2000 on repairs, even though the 10-year-old car will never be worth more than $3000 on the open market; they may have over-invested in the car by $1000.\n\n\n== Avoiding ==\nOver-investing typically occurs in assets that are partly investment goods and partially consumption goods. Houses and cars are investment goods in the sense that the purchaser expects to be able to resell the asset in the future. They are also consumption goods in the sense that the owner is able to use the asset while he owns it. It is because of this consumption component that people tend to over-invest. They are using criteria other than purely financial ones when deciding how much to invest into the asset. They are prepared to spend more on a house or car than it is worth on the open market because they derive benefits from using them. Because of the confusion between consuming and investing, they may over-invest or under-invest compared to what they would do if the investment were clear. Another major problem is that people spend more on consumption value (such as home rent) because they own the asset and mistakenly think that they are investing, when really they are consuming a house bigger than the one they would normally rent. Although they gain something from consuming more, since it is more than they would normally consume, they are wasting some money on something they would not normally buy, and thus in a sense over-investing by over-consuming.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of finance topics"}
{"title": "Global tactical asset allocation", "text": "Global Tactical Asset Allocation, or GTAA, is a top-down investment strategy that attempts to exploit short-term mis-pricings among a global set of assets. The strategy focuses on general movements in the market rather than on performance of individual securities.\n\n\n== Hedge funds and asset allocation ==\nGTAA is believed to be derived from, and share some characteristics of, global macro hedge funds and tactical asset allocation (TAA). Global macro hedge funds, like GTAA, seek to profit from taking positions in major world equity, bond or currency markets. However, the two differ in the fact that global macro has been characterized by large, undiversified bets, while modern GTAA strategies are generally well-diversified and operate with risk controls. TAA decisions undertaken by managers of multi-asset funds, like GTAA decisions, are intended to enhance investment outcomes by overweighting and underweighting asset classes based on their expected performance over relatively short time periods (usually 3 to 6 months). While TAA, within multi-asset funds, is restricted to the asset classes contained in the fund's strategic asset allocation, GTAA strategies enjoys the privilege of accessing a broader opportunity set.\n\n\n== Strategies ==\nThe modern global tactical asset allocation program is composed of two separate strategies: strategic rebalancing and overlay. The strategic rebalancing element of GTAA program is designed to remove any unintentional asset allocation risk which can be caused by various factors, including: drift risk, which occurs when the value of underlying portfolio holdings moves away from the strategic benchmark due to differences in asset class returns, due to changes in asset valuation, cash holdings, currency deviations from stock selection, unintentional country deviations within underlying stock/bond portfolios, manager of benchmark transitions, and contributions to and redemptions from the portfolio. The overlay element of GTAA program is designed to capture excess return through intentional, opportunistic, long and short positions in asset classes and countries. The GTAA strategy can be viewed as making two major types of decisions: The first type is asset class timing, including stocks vs. bonds vs. cash, small-cap vs. large-cap stocks, value vs. growth stocks, emerging vs. developed stocks and bonds, etc. This kind of decision making is often referred to as TAA. The second type of decision is known as country or sector decisions within asset classes, including country selection in developed and emerging equity, as well as fixed income and currency markets. These are the global relative-value decisions which give meaning to the \"G\" in GTAA and distinguish the strategy from traditional market timing.\n\n\n== Portfolios ==\nIt is widely known that many institutional investment portfolios remain dominated by equity and interest rate risk, and that these allocations tend to remain motionless regardless of market conditions. Therefore, there is reason to establish a portfolio of alternative alpha sources, and GTAA represents just that, for myriad reasons: the performance differentials between asset classes are frequently substantial, the derivative instruments used in GTAA are, for the most part, highly liquid and transaction costs are low. The volume of assets managed with a focus on relative performance of asset classes is low compared to that focused on finding opportunities within asset classes, and a number of managers with very impressive teams, processes and track records can be identified. Furthermore, the analysis and decision making involved in GTAA is focused on cross-market comparisons which proves to differ from the comparison of securities within given markets. Accordingly, GTAA should be a good diversifier, particularly within an alpha portfolio.\nGTAA strategies provide investors with a series of exposures that may not otherwise be prevalent in their portfolios. Managing these exposures provides an opportunity for the generation of returns that share low correlations with other sources of active return, and they can also be expected to lead to more reliable added value.\n\n\n== References =="}

Speculators hope to profit from the relative changes in price between the initial and offsetting positions.  Contracts may be spread against different months or different markets. \nTraders are concerned with whether the changes in the difference between the sides of the spread are moving in their favor or not.  Position traders may hold trades longer and with less risk using spreads.\nIn order to find the information on seasonal spread, many traders use algorithms  retrieving past commodity volatility and performance. \nImportant sources for seasonal traders are institutional reports, such as the COT report, which shows the positions held on commodities by the major market players.Lower good faith margin deposits required by commodity exchanges to trade spreads means more opportunities to leverage up and diversify positions.  Spreads may behave smoother than the underlying futures contracts.\nA crucial point whether seasonal spread trading works is the quality of the seasonal pattern.\nIt is important to keep checking the recurring price trends because trends can also change. For example, there was a very good seasonal pattern in gold in the 80s and 90s that no longer exists. The reason is a different demand behavior of gold buyers. Despite the fact that seasonal patterns can change, investing and trading based on seasonal patterns is very popular in the financial industry.

{"title": "Dynamic asset allocation", "text": "Dynamic asset allocation is a strategy used by investment products such as hedge funds, mutual funds, credit derivatives, index funds, principal protected notes (also known as guaranteed linked notes) and other structured investment products to achieve exposure to various investment opportunities and provide 100% principal protection.\nDynamic asset allocation includes CPPI, which consists of a guarantee, notionally related to a zero-coupon bond and an underlying investment. Assets are dynamically shifted (or allocated) between these two components depending largely on the performance of the underlying investments.\nIn some cases, certain products can use a borrowing facility to enhance exposure if the underlying investments experience strong returns. If the underlying investments decline in value, CPPI automatically deleverages, reducing exposure in falling markets. \nThe term 'Dynamic Asset Allocation' (DAA) can also refer to an investment strategy that seeks to produce high total returns irrespective of the performance of market indices using the tools of Tactical asset allocation/Global tactical asset allocation (TAA/GTAA) around a strategic benchmark.\nIndeed, many investment firms and commentators use the terms TAA, DAA, and GTAA interchangeably.In the arena of institutional asset management DAA mandates tend to have absolute return targets that are not related to market index returns (e.g. USD LIBOR + 500bps), while TAA mandates will tend to have performance targets that reference market indices (e.g. 50% S&P 500/ 50% Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index + 200bps).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nTactical asset allocation\nGlobal tactical asset allocation\nConstant proportion portfolio insurance\nFinancial risk management \u00a7 Investment management\nHedge funds\nMutual fund\nCredit derivative\nIndex fund\nPrincipal protected note\nStructured investment products\nZero-coupon bond"}
{"title": "Clientele effect", "text": "The clientele effect is the idea that the set of investors attracted to a particular kind of security will affect the price of the security when policies or circumstances change.\nFor instance, some investors want a company that doesn't pay dividends but instead invests that money in growing the business, whereas other investors prefer a stock that pays a high dividend, and still others want one that balances payout and reinvestment. If a company changes its dividend policy substantially, it is said to be subject to a clientele effect as some of its investors (its established clientele) decide to sell the security due to the change.  Although commonly used in reference to dividend or coupon (interest) rates, it can also be used in the context of leverage (debt levels), changes in line of business, taxes, and other aspects of the company.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe clientele effect refers to the idea that certain types of investors are attracted to particular types of securities or investment vehicles. For example, a company that issues a high-yield bond may attract a different type of investor than a company that issues a low-risk, low-yield bond.\nFor investors, it can be important to consider the types of securities that are likely to appeal to their desired clientele. For example, an investor who is looking for a stable, low-risk investment may be more likely to choose a bond issued by a stable, financially sound company, while an investor who is willing to take on more risk in exchange for the potential for higher returns may be more interested in a high-yield bond.\nFor companies, the clientele effect can be an important consideration when deciding on the types of securities to issue.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nClientele effect on Investopedia"}

{"title": "Expected commercial value", "text": "Expected commercial value (ECV), also known as estimated commercial value, is a prospect-weighted value for a \"project\" with unclear conclusions; it is similar to expected net existing value (ENPV). In general ECV is used as a supplementary capital budgeting technique, in that it allows an analyst to compare each project's expected value against its net present value as usually calculated, i.e. using planned and contracted costs. The company can thereby maximize the value and worth of its portfolio of projects, while working within its budget constraints.\nAs with ENPV, developments are defined to represent different project outcomes, with each scenario being assigned a possibility. A project value is computed for each scenario, and the expected commercial value is obtained by multiplying each situation's value by the scenario odds and adding the results. Depending on the procedures used to estimate the value of the project under each scenario, ECV can be a useful way to address project uncertainties. However, as indicated below, the technique often involves explanations that may or may not be appropriate.\nSeveral techniques are used to estimate the probabilities and cashflows of the scenarios; often, the project may be broken down into stages which are represented in a decision tree. In reality, technical and commercial successes are not definite outcomes. There are changeable degrees of technical success and, assuming the product is launched, commercial sales could be anywhere within a variety of possibilities. Still, depending on the assertion, the simple formula may provide a satisfactory calculation. More generally, because ECV is a simplified version of ENPV, it has the limitations of the more general approach (including omission of non-financial sources of project value, and the potential for insufficient treatment of risk).\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== See also ==\nrNPV\nFirst Chicago Method\nPenalized present value\nValuation using discounted cash flows#Determine equity value"}

Passive investors, on the other hand, feel that simply investing in a market index fund may produce potentially higher long-term results (pointing out that the majority of mutual funds underperform market indexes). Active investors feel that a less efficient market (prices inhering all news, and hence potential) should favor active stock selection: for example, smaller companies are not followed as closely as larger blue-chip firms, and may then trade at a discount to true value. The core-/satellite concept combines a passive style in an efficient market and an active style in less efficient markets.Growth vs. Value:  Active investors can be divided into growth and value seekers. Proponents of growth seek companies they expect (on average) to increase earnings by 15% to 25%. Value investors look for bargains \u2014 cheap stocks that are often out of favor, such as cyclical stocks that are at the low end of their business cycle. A value investor is primarily attracted by asset-oriented stocks with low prices compared to underlying book, replacement, or liquidation values. These two styles may offer a diversification effect: returns on growth stocks and value stocks are not highly correlated, thus by diversifying between growth and value, investors may reduce risk and still enjoy long-term return potential.Small Cap vs. Large Cap:  Some investors use the size of a company as the basis for investing. Studies of stock returns going back to 1925 have suggested that \"smaller is better,\" and on average, the highest returns have come from stocks with the lowest market capitalization, the so-called \"Size premium\". At the same time, small-cap stocks have higher price volatility, which translates into higher risk. (Also, there have been long periods when large-cap stocks have outperformed.) Some investors then choose the middle ground and invest in mid-cap stocks seeking a tradeoff between volatility and return. \n\n\n== See also ==\nStyle investing\nStyle drift\nReturns-based style analysis\nAsset allocation\nFinancial risk management \u00a7 Investment management\nGrowth investing\nValue investing\nLow-volatility investing\nMomentum investing\nQuality investing\nMagic Formula investing\nConservative Formula Investing\nBuy and hold\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Asset location", "text": "Asset location (AL) is a term used in personal finance to refer to how investors distribute their investments across savings vehicles including taxable accounts, tax-exempt accounts (e.g., TFSA, Roth IRA, ISAs, TESSAs), tax-deferred accounts (e.g., Canadian RRSP, American 401(k) and IRAs, British SIPPs, Irish Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (RPSA), and German Riester pensions), trust accounts (e.g., grantor retainer annuity trusts, generation-skipping trusts, charitable remainder trusts, charitable lead trusts), variable life insurance policies, foundations, and onshore vs. offshore accounts.While asset allocation (AA) determines what assets to own and in what proportions, AL determines where those assets are held.  While the objective of AA is to create portfolios with the greatest return for a level of risk, and to optimize individuals' risk exposure according to their risk tolerance, goals and investment time frame, the objective of AL is to maximize the benefits of different account-types - usually to minimize taxes. There are other objectives that can be personal (e.g., the liquidity of the wealth, the expected use of the funds, privacy, etc.).\nIn the discussion below the effective tax rate for any asset depends on a personal tax bracket, different countries' treatment of different types of income, personal frequency of realizing the tax liability (e.g. capital gains only taxable when sold after a multi-year holding period), the mix of income-types generated by an asset, and the net tax effect that includes both tax debits and credits (e.g. the treatment of dividend income in Canada and Great Britain).\n\n\n== Location Choice Methodology ==\n\n\n=== Tax Rates ===\nAlthough there is no academic support, it is common (now declining) to hear that assets with the highest effective tax rates should be prioritized in tax-shelter accounts.  This will have been broadly appropriate over the 30 years from the 1980s to the 2000s in North America, as interest rates declined and debt's total returns matched the returns of equity.  The rule is dependent on the assumption that total returns from different asset-types are equal.  When interest rates are low and expected to rise that assumption will not be valid.\n\n\n=== Tax Efficiency ===\nAnother common metric to decide which assets should be prioritized is tax-efficiency.  This equals the dollars of tax payable per principal invested - the multiple of the asset's rate of return by its effective tax rate.  Another way to look at the same metric is as the difference between the asset's nominal rate of return and its after-tax rate of return.\nThis metric measures the tax-sheltering benefits of the first year only.  Reed  finds that this metric fails over the life of the accounts. Given two assets with the same tax-efficiency, the asset with the larger rate of return will always create larger benefits in tax-exempt accounts.  Even when a high-return asset has a lower tax-efficiency, given enough time it creates more benefits.\nIt is only when the effective tax rate is very low that its importance relative to the rate of return is equally strong or stronger.\n\n\n=== Cumulative Benefit ===\nReed calculates the cumulative tax savings over varying time spans from tax-free growth. For tax-deferred accounts there may be an additional bonus (or penalty) from a lower (or higher) tax rate on withdrawal vs. contribution.  Assets with the largest benefits are given priority into tax shelters.  He points out that re-balancing to some asset allocation will reduce the benefits from asset location. \nHe concludes that 'it all depends' and general rules of thumb are not valid.  For example, given enough time high return assets create the largest benefits from tax-free growth, but there may not be enough time, or the high return asset may result in a portfolio large enough to create a penalty from higher withdrawal tax rates.  \n\n\n=== Asset Types ===\nCommon advice is to locate tax-inefficient assets (such as bonds and real estate investment trusts) in the tax-advantaged accounts.  This is to fully utilize any long-term capital gain, or capital gains allowances available in taxable accounts.  Place income-generating investments into tax-deferred or non-taxable accounts, and place equity investments into taxable accounts.  The deciding factor is apparently the effective tax rate on the asset's income.\nFor the same reason, tax-exempt bonds, national savings certificates and other similar tax-privileged securities are best located in fully taxable accounts. Shoven and Sialm provided an analysis of the decision point when income producing equities should be sheltered and optimal portfolio choice for each type of account. Individual stocks, passive index funds, or exchange-traded funds are generally regarded as tax-efficient and, consequently, better placed in taxable accounts, when more heavily taxed income generating assets, such as bonds, real estate investment trusts, and so on, are available for secretion in a tax sheltered location.\nActively managed mutual funds or unit trusts may also prove to be better located in tax-sheltered vehicles, because equities held through financial intermediaries tend to be taxed more, due to high turnover, than individual equities held by an investor for the long term, who has the opportunity to plan the realization of gains and offset losses. Siegel and Montgomery demonstrate conclusively that taxes and inflation substantially dampen compound returns especially for equity investors.\n\n\n== An Alternate Model ==\nWilliam Reichenstein  proposes an alternate model.  He ignores completely the tax-sheltering benefits of tax-deferred and tax-exempt accounts. His AL objective is not to maximize those benefits.  He uses the AL to fine-tune the AA decision using mean-variance optimization (MVO) of Modern portfolio theory. MVO uses the means, variances, and co-variance matrix of all assets, along with a utility function to manage risk tolerances.\nWhen assets are held in taxable accounts their after-tax means and variances will be smaller than for those in tax-shelter accounts.  Reichenstein considers each asset-type to have a taxable variant and a tax-free variant, with their different metrics.  The MVO process results in an optimal AA for both the taxable and the tax-free asset.  The AL falls out from this conclusion.\n\n\n== Patterns of Behavior ==\nSurveys of households have shown that there is often a gulf between where assets are located and where some people think they ought to be, to provide an optimal tax outcome. Reed's re-balancing model rarely shows a difference of more than 10% after 30 years, unless withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts are at lower rates.  So it may be that households are correct.  Amromin  argues that job income insecurity, penalties and restrictions on withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts explain why people are tax-inefficient with their investments. Employers\u2019 matches in defined contribution retirement plans and the structure of the social security system also play a part in driving low tax equity investments into sheltered accounts.Bodie and Crane studied TIAA-CREF participants and concluded that investors chose similar asset allocations in their taxable and tax-deferred accounts, with little apparent regard for the benefits of tax efficient asset location. Barber and Odean surveyed brokerage records and found that more than half of the households held taxable bonds in their taxable accounts, despite available alternatives, and that the preference for holding equity mutual funds in retirement accounts appeared to be stronger than that for holding taxable bonds.\nOther commentators suggest decisions concerning the use of home equity and mortgage debt as a substitute for consumer debt have driven choice of portfolio location. An idealized example shows that over a 25-year interval, the difference between extreme asset location choices yielded a compounded 18% differential in return.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAsset allocation\nIncome tax\nPersonal finance\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nInvestopedia article on Asset Location\nLaura F.

{"title": "Dead Cat Bounce", "text": "Dead Cat Bounce was an Irish comedy band made up of Demian Fox (drums), Shane O'Brien (bass) and James Walmsley (guitar and lead vocals). Based in Dublin, but touring all over the world, the group performed all-original comedy songs in variety of musical styles.\n\n\n== History ==\nThey met at Trinity College Dublin in 2002 where they were all founding members of the sketch comedy group H-BAM which also included Aisling Bea. In late 2007 Fox, O'Brien and Walmsley were living together in Dublin and began to write a sketch show which they performed in the Project Arts Centre in January 2008. They chose the name Dead Cat Bounce (a stockbroking term) because the show opened with three stockbrokers standing over the body of a dead hooker. Will Ferrell happened to be in the audience at this very first show.In April 2008 the group premiered a second show Dead Cat Bounce...Radio Play in Dublin\u2019s Sugar Club. This was in the style of a 1950s radio recording and Mick Cullinan, who had directed the first show, was brought in to play keyboards and do live sound effects. This was also the first time the four played together as a band. In August 2008, they took both shows to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, performing them back to back every night for a month.\nIn October 2008, they recorded a pilot TV sketch show for RT\u00c9 which was part of Project Ha Ha \u2013 a season of comedy pilots aired on RT\u00c9 Two in January 2009.In March 2009, they were invited to perform at the Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal, appearing in a televised gala hosted by Martin Short.In January 2010 they made a series of clips for BBC Online entitled 'The Maida Vale Incident'. These were shot at Maida Vale Studios in London and featured the songs 'Midget', 'Overenthusiastic Contraceptive Lady' and 'Four Lads'. They also include a cameo from T4 presenter Miquita Oliver.In 2010, Dead Cat Bounce toured Australia for the first time, performing at the Adelaide Fringe Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival and Sydney Comedy Festival where they were awarded the Time Out Jury Prize. The following year they won the People's Choice Award at the Sydney Comedy Festival.In addition to comedy festivals, Dead Cat Bounce also performed at several major music festivals, including Electric Picnic, Oxegen, Leeds and Reading festivals.The band made a number of music videos, most notably \"Rugby\" which was first aired on the RT\u00c9 show Republic of Telly and became the fifth most viewed YouTube clip in Ireland in 2011. In 2010 the band also recorded a charity single for Movember entitled \"Every Time You Shave a Moustache Dies\".\n\n\n== Touring shows ==\nDead Cat Bounce\nFirst performed in January 2008 in the Project Arts Centre, Dublin, and brought to the Edinburgh Festival 2008, this self-titled show was made up of a series of twelve sketches set in the same hotel room.

A seven-minute \u2018musical\u2019 based on the Great Famine of Ireland.\nDead Cat Bounce...Radio Play\nFirst performed in April 2008 in the Sugar Club, Dublin and brought to the Edinburgh Festival 2008, this show was in the style of a 1950s radio recording and featured a live foley artist. It was also the first show in which Dead Cat Bounce played together as a band and included the songs \u2018Golf!\u2019 and \u2018Damn Girl\u2019 which would later feature in their RT\u00c9 pilot.\nDead Cat Bounce...Wired\nFirst performed in the Sugar Club, Dublin in April 2009, and brought to the Edinburgh Festival 2009, this was billed as a \u2018rock and roll sketch show\u2019 and combined songs with character sketches performed on mic. It included all seven songs featured on the live EP 'Dead Cat Bounce, live at the Sugar Club'.Dead Cat Bounce...Too Fast For Love\nDeveloped on tour in Australia and brought to the Edinburgh Fringe in 2010, the show was the first to see Dead Cat Bounce play characters in a dysfunctional rock band. It includes all three songs featured in The Kasabian Incident filmed for BBC Online.Dead Cat Bounce...Caged Heat\nFirst performed in Whelan's, Dublin on 10 February 2011, this show toured Australia, Ireland and the UK and was brought to the Edinburgh Festival 2011.

{"title": "Forecast period (finance)", "text": "In corporate finance, in the context of discounted cash flow valuation, the forecast period is the time period during which explicitly forecast, individual yearly cash flows are input to the valuation-formula. \nCash flows after the forecast period are represented by a fixed number - the \"terminal value\" - determined using assumptions relating to the sustainable compound annual growth rate or exit multiple. \nThere are no fixed rules for determining the duration of the forecast period.  However, choosing a forecast period of 10 years, for example, will not be meaningful when individual cash flows can only reasonably be modeled for four years; see Cashflow forecast. \nThe number of forecasting years is therefore to be limited by the \"meaningfulness\" of the individual yearly cash flows ahead.  \nAddressing this, there are three typical methods of determining the forecast period.\n\nBased on company positioning:  The forecast period corresponds to the years where an excess return is achievable.  In the years chosen the company should expect to generate a return on new investments greater than its cost of capital. This will be based on its expected competitiveness, coupled with known barriers to entry. See: Porter's five forces, a well known tool for analyzing the competition of a business; and Sustainable growth rate  \u00a7 From a financial perspective for discussion re the economic argument here.\nBased on exit strategy:  The number of years after which an \"exit\" is planned.  An exit can either be positive (merger, acquisition, initial public offering) or negative (bankruptcy). This method is typically used by investors in venture capital and private equity, planning a positive exit. See: Private equity  \u00a7 Investment timescales; Venture capital  \u00a7 Financing stages.\nBased on market characteristics: Determine a forecast period by choosing a number of years based on the characteristics of the market.

{"title": "Behavioral portfolio theory", "text": "Behavioral portfolio theory (BPT), put forth in 2000 by Shefrin and Statman, provides an alternative to the assumption that the ultimate motivation for investors is the maximization of the value of their portfolios. It suggests that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals. It does not follow the same principles as the capital asset pricing model, modern portfolio theory and the arbitrage pricing theory. A behavioral portfolio bears a strong resemblance to a pyramid with distinct layers. Each layer  has well defined goals. The base layer is devised in a way that it is meant to prevent financial disaster, whereas, the upper layer is devised to attempt to maximize returns, an attempt to provide a shot at becoming rich.\nBPT is a descriptive theory based on the SP/A theory of Lola Lopes (1987), and closely related to Roy's safety-first criterion. The theory is described as a single account version: BPT-SA, which is very closely related to the SP/A theory. \nIn this multiple account version, investors can have fragmented portfolios, just as we observe among investors. They even propose in their initial article a Cobb\u2013Douglas utility function that shows how money is allocated in the two mental accounts.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMarket sentiment\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Dumb agent theory", "text": "The dumb agent theory (DAT) states that many people making individual buying and selling decisions will better reflect true value than any one individual can. In finance this theory is predicated on the efficient-market hypothesis (EMH).  One of the first instances of the dumb agent theory in action was with the Policy Analysis Market (PAM); a futures exchange developed by DARPA. While this project was quickly abandoned by the Pentagon, its idea is now implemented in futures exchanges and prediction markets such as Intrade, Newsfutures and Predictify. The DAT is technically a hypothesis, not a theory.\nWhile first mentioned strictly by name in relation to PAM in 2003, the dumb agent theory was originally conceived (as the Dumb Smart Market) by James Surowiecki in 1999. Here, Surowiecki differentiated from the EMH stating that it \"doesn't mean that markets are always right.\"  Instead, he argues that markets are subject to manias and panics because \"people are always shouting out\" their stock picks.  This, in turn, results in other investors worrying about these picks and becoming influenced by them, which ultimately drives the markets (irrationally) up or down.  His argument states that if market decisions were made independently of each other, and with the sole goal of being correct (as opposed to being in line with what others are choosing), then the markets would produce the best choice possible and eliminate biases such as groupthink, the bandwagon effect and the Abilene paradox.\n\n\n== PAM ==\nThe Policy Analysis Market (PAM), while technically a futures market, was described as utilizing the dumb agent theory.  The main difference, as argued by James Surowiecki, is that in a futures market the current stock prices are known in advance, while in order for the dumb agent theory to work, they should be unknown to the investor prior to the decision making period (which is possible only with a prediction market).\n\n\n== Prediction markets ==\nFor the dumb agent theory to hold, investors should not know what other investors are doing prior to making their decision.  While this is technically impossible in a futures exchange (because what other people are deciding dictates the price of the security), it can be done in a Prediction Market. Certain prediction markets are set up in this manner (Such as Predictify, although it allows for participants to change their answers after their initial prediction).\n\n\n== Dumb agent theory outside the financial markets ==\nUSS Scorpion (SSN-589) was a nuclear submarine of the United States Navy lost at sea on June 5, 1968.  While a public search did not yield any clues as to its location, Dr. John Craven, the Chief Scientist of the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Division, decided to employ the Bayesian search theory in order to establish its location.  This involved formulating different hypotheses as to its location and using a probability distribution to combine the information and find the point of highest probability.  The different hypotheses were taken from various independent sources, such as mathematicians, submarine specialists, and salvage men.  The point Craven found ended up being 220 yards from the actual position of the sunken vessel.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Dumb Agent Theory Explained\" at DumbAgent.com"}

{"title": "Dividend puzzle", "text": "The dividend puzzle is a concept in finance in which companies that pay dividends are rewarded by investors with higher valuations, even though, according to many economists, it should not matter to investors whether a firm pays dividends or not. The reasoning goes that dividends, from the investor\u2019s point of view, should have no effect on the process of valuing equity because the investor already owns the firm and, thus, he/she should be indifferent to either getting the dividends or having them re-invested in the firm. Another reason for economists to be puzzled is that equity holders pay a higher tax rate on dividend payouts compared to capital gains from the firm repurchasing shares as an alternative payout policy. \nThe puzzle evolved from the Modigliani\u2013Miller theorems of 1959 and 1961.\nThe reasons for the dividend puzzle have been attributed to a wide range of factors, including uncertainties, psychological/behavioral economics issues, tax-related matters, and asymmetric information.\n\n\n== References ==\nRuben D.

{"title": "Implementation shortfall", "text": "In financial markets, implementation shortfall is the difference between the decision price and the final execution price (including commissions, taxes, etc.) for a trade. This is also known as the \"slippage\". Agency trading is largely concerned with minimizing implementation shortfall and finding liquidity.\n\n\n== Decision price ==\nThe decision price is the price of the stock that prompted the decision to buy or sell. The most common decision price is the close price or the arrival price. If we split the decision to buy a stock from the actual trading of the stock, as is often the case with fund managers (decision makers) and brokers (trade executors), you can see why both are used.\nFrom the fund manager's point of view, his decision to trade is often based on the closing price of the day's trading (along with the entire history of the stock and other signals/indicators). When he decides to buy a particular stock the next day, it is because he believes that the price will go up from that closing price. Thus his decision price is the close price.\nHowever the broker, unless she is explicitly told what levels to buy at or what prompted the desire to buy, does not know when or why the decision was made. Her best guess is that the current price at the time the order is received is what prompted the decision and thus her decision price is the arrival price. There is no common definition of this price, but the broker normally uses the last traded price or the \"mid price\" - equal to the average of the current bid and ask prices being quoted at the time the order was received.\nBrokerage firms specialize in developing algorithmic strategies, and providing them to the institutional investment community, that aid in the quest to minimise slippage from benchmarks such as implementation shortfall, volume-weighted average price or time-weighted average price. Alpha Profiling is an example of an algorithmic method of minimising implementation shortfall.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlgorithmic trading\nMarket impact\nMarket microstructure\n\n\n== External links ==\nTrade Strategy and Execution (CFA Institute)\nMarket impact models and optimal execution algorithms"}
{"title": "Covered warrant", "text": "In finance a covered warrant (sometimes called naked warrant) is a type of warrant that has been issued without an accompanying bond or equity.   Like a normal warrant, it allows the holder to buy or sell a specific amount of equities, currency, or other financial instruments from the issuer at a specified price at a predetermined date.  \nUnlike normal warrants, they are usually issued by financial institutions instead of share-issuing companies and are listed as fully tradable securities on a number of stock exchanges. They can also have a variety of underlying instruments, not just equities, and may allow the holder to buy or sell the underlying asset. These attributes make it possible to use covered warrants as a tool to speculate on financial markets.\n\n\n== Structure and features ==\nA covered warrant gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy (\"call\" warrant) or to sell (\"put\" warrant) an underlying asset at a specified price (the \"strike\" or \"exercise\" price) by a predetermined date. The price paid for this right is the \"premium\" and with covered warrants, you cannot lose more than this initial premium paid.  They are limited liability instruments so there are no further payments or margin calls required to maintain a covered warrant position. Covered warrants offer a flexible alternative to private investors who seek to gain the leverage benefits of derivatives, but who wish to limit their risk.\nWhen the issuer sells a warrant to an investor, they typically \"cover\" (or hedge) their exposure by buying the underlying instrument in the market. Covered warrants have an average life of 6 to 12 months, although some have maturities of several years.\nIn contrast to \"traditional\" equity warrants, with covered warrants, no new issuance of common stock occurs if the warrant is exercised. The underlying shares of common stock are usually either owned by the issuer of the covered warrants or the issuer has a mechanism, such as owning equity warrants for the underlying shares, through which they can obtain the shares.\nCovered warrants are very popular due to the following qualities:\n\nLow cost\nFlexibility\nLimited liability\nMulti-strategy options\n\n\n== Comparison with options ==\nCovered warrants are very similar to options\u2014much more so than \"traditional\" warrants.  This is because covered warrants, just like options, can be created to allow holders to benefit from either rising prices or falling prices, by having both put and call warrants. They can also be created on a wide variety of underlying instruments, not just equities and they are fairly standardised and are mostly traded on exchanges.\nThe main difference is that warrants tend to have longer maturity dates, typically measured in years instead of months (as with options), and are easier to access for individuals as they can be bought and sold in the same way as shares in the stock exchange.\n\n\n== Trading warrants ==\nWarrants are listed on a number of major exchanges, including the London Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, and Hong Kong Stock Exchange. They are popular with individual investors and traders particularly in Hong Kong, China, and European countries (especially Italy). They are seen as a flexible tool offering leveraged exposure to a wide range of underlying assets such as equity, asset baskets, indices, currencies and commodities, while offering the benefits of transparency and liquidity.\nPopular indices, for example, include the FTSE100 in the UK or Germany's DAX, and popular commodities include oil, gold, and wheat.\n\n\n== Risks ==\nThe main exposure is to market risk as the warrant will be profitable only when the market price exceeds the strike price for a \"call warrant\" or is below the strike for a \"put warrant\". The inherent leveraging effect of the warrant significantly increases the risks and traders that are using warrant to speculate can make or lose significant sums very quickly. With covered warrants, the maximum loss is limited to the price paid for the warrant (ask or offer price) plus any commission or other transaction charges. Thus, although warrants are classed as high risk they are not as risky as other investment products such as contracts for differences or spread betting in which an investor would have to pay for future losses.\nAnother aspect of risk is that an investor could lose their entire investment if the corporation issuing the warrant becomes insolvent.\n\n\n== See also ==\nWarrant (finance)\nOption (finance)\nDerivative (finance)\nContract for difference\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAn explanation to Covered Warrants by stockbroker TD Waterhouse\nList of warrants currently issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland"}
{"title": "Vix pervenit", "text": "Vix pervenit is an encyclical, promulgated by Pope Benedict XIV on November 1, 1745, which condemned the practice of charging interest on loans as usury. Because the encyclical was addressed to the bishops of Italy, it is generally not considered ex cathedra. The Holy Office applied the encyclical to the whole of the Roman Catholic Church on July 29, 1836, during the reign of Pope Gregory XVI.The encyclical codified church teachings which date back to early ecumenical councils, at a time when scholastic philosophy (which did not regard money as a productive input) was increasingly coming into conflict with capitalism.\n\n\n== Historical context ==\nMedieval Christian interest payment theology began with the First Council of Nicaea (325), which forbade clergy from engaging in usury.  Later ecumenical councils applied this regulation to the laity.Lateran III decreed that persons who accepted interest on loans could receive neither the sacraments nor Christian burial. Pope Clement V made the belief in the right to usury heresy in 1311, and abolished all secular legislation in the Papal States which allowed it. Pope Sixtus V condemned the practice of charging interest as \"detestable to God and man, damned by the sacred canons and contrary to Christian charity\".  Theological historian John Noonan argues that \"the doctrine [of usury] was enunciated by popes, expressed by three ecumenical councils, proclaimed by bishops, and taught unanimously by theologians\".\nHowever, the 16th-century Fifth Lateran Council gave explicit permission for interest-taking in some situations, showing the matter was never really clear-cut: (...) We declare and define, with the approval of the Sacred Council, that the above-mentioned credit organisations (Mounts of Piety), established by states and hitherto approved and confirmed by the authority of the Apostolic See, do not introduce any kind of evil or provide any incentive to sin if they receive, in addition to the capital, a moderate sum for their expenses and by way of compensation, provided it is intended exclusively to defray the expenses of those employed and of other things pertaining (as mentioned) to the upkeep of the organizations, and provided that no profit is made therefrom. They ought not, indeed, to be condemned in any way. Rather, such a type of lending is meritorious and should be praised and approved. It certainly should not be considered as usurious; (...)\n\n\n== Content of the encyclical ==\n\n\n=== Title ===\nAs is usual practice with encyclicals, the text derived its title from the Latin opening words, which translate into English as \"It has hardly reached [...]\". The opening sentence refers to a debate, held in Italy at the time, about the validity of interest-bearing loan contracts, which had reached the Pontiff's ears.\n\n\n=== Doctrine ===\nThe encyclical states:\n\nThe nature of the sin called usury has its proper place and origin in a loan contract. This financial contract between consenting parties demands, by its very nature, that one return to another only as much as he has received. The sin rests on the fact that sometimes the creditor desires more than he has given. Therefore he contends some gain is owed him beyond that which he loaned, but any gain which exceeds the amount he gave is illicit and usurious.\nThe prohibition was unequivocal, rejecting even \"moderate or small\" rates of interest. The prohibition on usury did not extend only to loan contracts but also condemned those who \"falsely and rashly persuade themselves\" that \"other just contracts exist, for which it is permissible to receive a moderate amount of interest. Should any one think like this, he will oppose not only the judgment of the Catholic Church on usury, but also common human sense and natural reason\".\n\n\n=== Extrinsic interest ===\nThe encyclical, however, did allow extrinsic interest to be charged, stating that \"legitimate reasons arise to demand something over and above the amount due on the contract\" as long as those reasons are \"not at all intrinsic to the contract\". The Holy Office would later expand upon these extrinsic justifications for interest in 1780 and 1784 to include \"compensation\" for the hazards and delays of repayment.\n\n\n== Effects of the encyclical ==\n\n\n=== 18th and 19th century ===\n\nThe encyclical was published one year after an influential and controversial three-volume defense of usury by Francesco Scipione. Months after the publication of Vix pervenit, Maffei published a second, almost identical edition of his treatise-which contained the full text of the encyclical and a dedication to Benedict XIV, his friend-with the imprimatur of the Catholic Church.  Papal historian John Pollard argues that the encyclical's prohibition on usury contributed to the dependence of the Holy See upon Jewish bankers like James de Rothschild.The text of the encyclical was destroyed in several countries. In France, the ban on usury persisted until the French Revolution of 1789, the same year in which Turgot's M\u00e9moire sur les prets d'argent, a defense of usury, was allowed to be published.Pope Leo XIII's Rerum novarum (1891) laments that usury is \"still practiced by covetous and grasping men\". By the 19th century, the debate over lending within the Catholic Church disappeared, as the provision of credit had become viewed as political economy issue rather than a theological one.In 1830, following the widespread acceptance of the Napoleonic code, which allowed interest, throughout Europe, with the approval of Pope Pius VIII, the Inquisition of Rome, distinguished the doctrine of usury from the practice of usury, decreeing that confessors should no longer disturb the latter.\n\n\n=== Current status ===\nAccording to the Catholic Encyclopedia, circa 1912, \"The Holy See admits practically the lawfulness of interest on loans, even for ecclesiastical property, though it has not promulgated any doctrinal decree on the subject\". W. Hohoff in Die Bedeutung der Marxschen Kapitalkritik argues that \"the Church has never admitted the justice of interest whether on money or on capital, but has merely tolerated the institution, just as under the Old Dispensation, God tolerated polygamy and divorce\".The Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917, allowed those responsible for the church's financial affairs at the parish and diocesan levels to invest in interest-bearing securities \"for the legal rate of interest (unless it is evident that the legal rate is exorbitant), or even for a higher rate, provided that there be a just and proportionate reason\".A specialist in Catholic social doctrine, Miller A., argues, circa 1994, that \"the words 'bank' and 'banking' are almost nonexistent in the documents of modern Catholic social teaching. Perhaps because the medieval teaching was never formally retracted that money was unproductive and therefore money lending at interest was therefore immoral, yet the church itself became an active investor.... Or perhaps it was because the church was deeply involved in financial matters at the highest levels that it was in no position to criticise\".Writing for This Rock magazine, David Palm argued with a more holistic approach, taking into account Mosaic Law, the teaching of Jesus, the above-mentioned Fifth Lateran Council, development of economic sciences and especially the development of the practical economy since the Industrial Revolution, that the old economic mentality, expressed in Vix Pervenit, simply fails to capture the entire complexity of the modern world. The Fifth Lateran Council (1515) defined usury as follow: \"For, that is the real meaning of usury: when, from its use, a thing which produces nothing is applied to the acquiring of gain and profit without any work, any expense or any risk\". According to Palm, the sin of usury as defined by the Fifth Lateran Council dogmatically still exists in the Catholic Church, but the nature of financial transaction has changed compared to the time of the Fifth Lateran Council: \"A loan that was usurious at one point in history, due to the unfruitfulness of money, is not usurious later, when the development of competitive markets has changed the nature of money itself\".No other papal solemn pronouncement than Vix pervenit touches the subject of usury, although in a 1999 speech John Paul II qualified usury as a \"grave social plague\".\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of encyclicals of Pope Benedict XIV\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Sources ===\nCarlen, C.

{"title": "Cantab Capital Partners", "text": "Cantab Capital Partners is a hedge fund based in Cambridge, England, co-founded by Dr. Ewan Kirk and Erich Schlaikjer. Cantab operates quantitative funds using computer models to drive investment decisions. As of Feb 2015 Cantab had $4.5 billion in assets under management, after launching with $30 million in 2006. The firm takes its name from Cantabrigia, the medieval Latin name for Cambridge. It is regulated in the UK by the Financial Conduct Authority. Cantab Capital Partners was acquired by GAM in 2016 and is since part of GAM Systematic.\n\n\n== Funds ==\nCantab's stated investment philosophy is that algorithmic trading can help to overcome cognitive biases inherent in human-based trading decisions, by exploiting persistent statistical relationships between markets. Taking a multi-asset, multi-model approach, the majority of Cantab's traded instruments are liquid futures and forwards, across currencies, fixed income, equity indices and commodities.\nCantab manages two investment funds: the CCP Quantitative Programme (launched 2007, with $30m) and the CCP Core Macro Programme (launched 2013). Both are computer-based algorithmic trading systems, also known as automated trading, black-box trading, algo trading or systematic trading.\nIn January 2013, Goldman Sachs became a minor investor in Cantab. Kirk is a former Goldman partner; Schlaikjer is a former Managing Director and European Chief Technology Officer of Goldman's Quantitative Strategies Group. Cantab is reported to have been granted access to Goldman's technology infrastructure.\n\n\n== Performance ==\nAt the end of December 2014 Cantab's leading fund, the CCP Quantitative Fund, had gained 39.3% over the previous 12 months. The fund gained 13 percent over January 2015 alone. These gains brought the fund to an annualized return of 11.38 percent since inception in March 2007; the Quantitative fund now has $3.5bn in assets under management.The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Cantab's 2014 results took place in the context of renewed investor interest in computer-traded funds and commodities-based funds.\n\n\n== Fee structure ==\nCantab\u2019s Core Macro Programme is notable for its fee structure, charging a 0.5 per cent management fee and 10 per cent of profits. Industry-standard fees among hedge funds are often 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of profits. Although algorithm-based hedge funds tend to offer lower fees, made possible by their technological infrastructure, The New York Times reported that Cantab had \"...lowered the fees to a point that not everybody can afford to do. Some industry experts, such as Robert Leonard of Credit Suisse, believe that such commission levels are unsustainable.\n\n\n== Employees ==\nCantab is largely staffed by mathematicians and scientists, many of whom have ties to nearby University of Cambridge. In a 2013 interview with the Financial Times, Kirk said \u201cWe have made a commitment to investors that we have no plans to be bigger than 80 professionals.\"\n\n\n== Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information ==\nIn 2015 Cantab donated \u00a35 million to launch the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information at Cambridge University. The research institute will use mathematical science techniques to analyse data for application in fields such as medicine, meteorology, urban planning and financial risk analysis. The Institute will have six lecturers and up to 18 Ph.D. students.The Institute was set-up in order to address the lack of philanthropic funding for data research, and to stimulate cutting-edge research in the area. In an interview with Pensions and Investments, Kirk said \"...it is much easier to get funding for medical science or computer science [than for] more theoretical subjects like mathematics\u201d. Kirk also characterised the donation as \"philanthropic\u201d and that the firm plans to keep its research in-house, while maintaining a \"rewarding dialogue\" with the Institute.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Boiler insurance", "text": "Boiler insurance (Boiler cover) is a type of insurance that covers repairs and in some instances, the replacement of a home boiler. It can also cover other parts of the central heating system and even plumbing and electrics.\n\n\n== Types of boiler coverage ==\nMore than 22 million UK households rely on a boiler for their heating and hot water. But boilers are not usually covered by standard home insurance and can be very costly to repair or replace. An owner of a building may purchase boiler insurance. Coverage is negotiated between the insurance carrier and may include the boiler only, the piping system, or the full heating system. Some insurance carriers also offer annual service packages.\nThe most costly coverage will include the full central heating system. Insurance is generally offered by gas and electric energy providers, although other companies also provide cover. Policies have various restrictions on the time of work and cost of repairs. Old equipment may not be insurable.\nBoiler cover however is not boiler insurance. Boiler cover is much more limited and has very strict guidelines on the amounts paid out towards repairs and new boilers. Insurance is regulated, whereas boiler cover is not. Boiler cover is generally cheaper and will cover most issues that arise with most boilers.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Market timing hypothesis", "text": "The market timing hypothesis is a theory of how firms and corporations in the economy decide whether to finance their investment with equity or with debt instruments. It is one of many such corporate finance theories, and is often contrasted with the pecking order theory and the trade-off theory, for example.  The idea that firms pay attention to market conditions in an attempt to time the market.\nBaker and Wurgler (2002), claim that market timing is the  first order determinant of a corporation's capital structure use of debt and equity. In other words, firms do not generally care whether they finance with debt or equity, they just choose the form of financing which, at that point in time, seems to be more valued by financial markets.Market timing is sometimes classified as part of the behavioral finance literature, because it does not explain why there would be any asset mispricing, or why firms would be better able to tell when there was mispricing than financial markets. Rather it just assumes these mispricing exists, and describes the behavior of firms under the even stronger assumption that firms can detect this mispricing better than markets can. However, any theory with time varying costs and benefits is likely to generate time varying corporate issuing decisions. This is true whether decision makers are behavioral or rational. \nThe empirical evidence for this hypothesis is at best, mixed. Baker and Wurgler themselves show that an index of financing that reflects how much of the financing was done during hot equity periods and how much during hot debt periods is a good indicator of firm leverage over long periods subsequently. Alti studied issuance events. He found that the effect of market timing disappears after only two years.Beyond such academic studies, a complete market timing theory ought to explain why at the same moment in time some firms issue debt while other firms issue equity. As yet nobody has tried to explain this basic problem within a market timing model. The typical version of the market timing hypothesis is thus somewhat incomplete as a matter of theory.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCorporate finance\nPecking order theory\nCapital structure\nTrade-off theory\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Sales comparison approach", "text": "The sales comparison approach (SCA) relies on the assumption that a matrix of attributes or significant features of a property drive its value. For examples, in the case of a single family residence, such attributes might be floor area, views, location, number of bathrooms, lot size, age of the property and condition of property.\n\n\n== Economic Basis ==\nThe sales comparison approach is based upon the principles of supply and demand, as well as upon the principle of substitution. Supply and demand indicates value through typical market behavior of both buyers and sellers. Substitution indicates that a purchaser would not purchase an improved property for any value higher than it could be replaced for on a site with equivalent utility, assuming no undue delays in construction.\n\n\n== Examples of Methods ==\nIn practice, the most common SCA method used by estate agents and real estate appraisers is the sales adjustment grid.  It uses a small number of recently sold properties in the immediate vicinity of the subject property to estimate the value of its attributes.  Adjustments to the comparables may be determined by trend analysis, matched-pairs analysis, or simple surveys of the market.\nMore advanced researchers and appraisers commonly employ statistical techniques based on multiple regression methods which generally compare a larger number of more geographically dispersed property transactions to determine the significance and magnitude of the impact of different attributes on property value.  Research has shown that the sales adjustment grid and the multiple regression model are theoretically the same, with the former applying more heuristic methods and the latter using statistical techniques.Spatial auto regression plagues these statistical techniques, since high priced properties tend to cluster together and therefore one property price is not independent of its neighbor.  Given property inflation and price cycles, both comparison techniques can become unreliable if the time interval between transactions sampled is excessive.  The other factor undermining a simplistic use of the SCA is the evolving nature of city neighborhoods, though in reality urban evolution occurs gradually enough to minimize its impact on this approach to value.\nIn more complex situations, such as litigation or contaminated property appraisal, appraisers develop SCA adjustments using widely accepted advanced techniques, such as repeat sales models (to measure house price appreciation over time), survey research (e.g. -- contingent valuation), case studies (to develop adjustments in complex situations) or other statistically based techniques.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nThe Appraisal of Real Estate, 12th Edition, by the Appraisal Institute is an industry-recognized textbook.\nThe Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, by The Appraisal Foundation, updated and published annually through the 2006 edition; henceforth, updated editions are to appear biannually.\nSales Comparison Approach, by Lloyd D.

{"title": "Tactical asset allocation", "text": "Tactical asset allocation (TAA) is a dynamic investment strategy that actively adjusts a portfolio's asset allocation. The goal of a TAA strategy is to improve the risk-adjusted returns of passive management investing.\n\n\n== Strategy descriptions ==\nTAA strategies can be either discretionary or systematic.\n\n\n=== Discretionary ===\nIn discretionary tactical asset allocation strategies, an investor modifies his asset allocation according to the valuation of the markets in which they are invested. Thus, someone who invested heavily in stocks might reduce their position when they perceive that other securities, such as bonds, are poised to outperform stocks. Unlike stock picking, in which the investor predicts which individual stocks will perform well, tactical asset allocation involves only judgments of the future return of complete markets or sectors. As such, some practitioners perceive it as a natural supplement to mutual fund investing, including passive management investing.\n\n\n=== Systematic ===\nSystematic tactical asset allocation strategies use a quantitative investment model to systematically exploit inefficiencies or temporary imbalances in equilibrium values among different asset classes. They are often based on financial market anomalies (inefficiencies) that have occurred in the past and are supported by academic and practitioner research. For example, many systematic TAA strategies try to use quantitative Trend Following or Relative Strength techniques to produce excess returns. These both aim to capitalize on momentum, a well-known market anomaly.\n\n\n== Considerations ==\nThe efficient-market hypothesis would imply that tactical asset allocation cannot increase risk-adjusted returns, since markets are already efficiently priced. If a tactical approach were found that could increase returns without an increase in risk, investors would flock to that inefficiency, and the advantage would go away. Many investors do not accept this hypothesis, however, and believe that inefficiencies in the market persist and can be exploited.\nMany factors determine the success of a TAA strategy. The investor needs to have the necessary knowledge, practical investment skills, dedication, and discipline to design and/or execute a successful tactical strategy. The specific market anomalies on which the strategy is based may change or disappear in the future. Other factors such as risk tolerance, market timing, portfolio size, investment expenses, etc. may also affect the portfolio performance.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nInvestors who utilize the tactical asset allocation strategy generally want to hedge risk in a volatile market. However, Larry Swedroe of CBS MoneyWatch described the strategy as an attempt to time the market, and provides an excuse for managers to increase revenue from trading fees due to the frequent activity the strategy requires. In a study conducted by Morningstar, Inc., they examined the \"net annualized return, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown from July 31, 2010, to December 31, 2011,\" of 163 tactical funds. They concluded that only a small percentage of firms outperformed the Vanguard Balanced Index, the exceptions being PIMCO and GMO (Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo) Global Asset Allocation. Updated to June 2013, they found that 20 percent of funds beat the Vanguard Balanced Index Fund, and just four had a better Sharpe ratio.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCyclical tactical asset allocation\nGlobal tactical asset allocation\nFinancial risk management \u00a7 Investment management\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nFaber, Mebane T. and Eric W.

{"title": "International Association of Insurance Supervisors", "text": "The International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) is a voluntary membership organization of insurance supervisors from over 190 jurisdictions, constituting 97% of the world's insurance premiums. It is the international standards-setting body for the insurance sector. The IAIS was established in 1994 and operates as a verein, a type of non-profit organisation under Swiss Civil Law.The IAIS' mission is to promote effective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance industry in order to develop and maintain fair, safe and stable insurance markets for the benefit and protection of policyholders and to contribute to the maintenance of global financial stability.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe IAIS' activities are supported by its secretariat and headed by a secretary general. The IAIS is hosted by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS).\nThe IAIS works in partnership with BIS-hosted committees such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) and the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure (CPMI), as well as other BIS-hosted entities such as the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) and the International Association of Deposit Insurers (IADI). The IAIS also works closely with other standard-setting bodies not hosted by the BIS, such as the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).\n\n\n=== Committees ===\nThe IAIS delivers on its mission through a committee system made up of its members. The Committee system is led by an executive committee whose 38 members come from different regions of the world, representing advanced and developing insurance markets.\nThe executive committee is supported by the following five Committees established under its by-laws:\nAudit and Risk Committee;\nBudget Committee;\nImplementation and Assessment Committee;\nMacroprudential Committee; and\nPolicy Development Committee.Committees may establish subcommittees to help carry out their duties.\n\n\n== Activities ==\nGuided by its strategic plan, the IAIS develops a two-year roadmap setting out the specific projects that the IAIS will undertake over the next two years. Projects and activities contained within the roadmap can be broadly divided into three categories:\n\nStandard setting: The IAIS develops supervisory material (principles, standards and guidance) for effective supervision of insurance-related activities. Notably, the IAIS has developed the Insurance Core Principles (ICPs) and the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame). The ICPs provide the globally accepted standards for supervision of the insurance sector. ComFrame builds on the ICPs and establishes supervisory standards and guidance focusing on the effective group-wide supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (IAIGs). In 2019, the IAIS also published version 2.0 of the Insurance Capital Standard  and the Holistic Framework for the Assessment and Mitigation of Systemic Risk in the Insurance Sector.  The IAIS also develops supporting material to supplement its supervisory material and provide additional background on specific areas of interest to insurance supervisors.\nImplementation and Assessment: The IAIS actively promotes the implementation of its supervisory material. Working closely with international organisations and regional groups of supervisors, it supports training seminars and conferences, as well as initiatives to support financial inclusion. In addition, the IAIS conducts assessments and peer reviews of observance of supervisory material, consistent with the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) conducted by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.\nFinancial stability: The IAIS has a role in the identification, assessment and mitigation of systemic risk in the insurance sector. Activities in the area of financial stability include monitoring global insurance market trends and developments and detecting the possible build-up of systemic risk in the global insurance sector, as well as analyzing and developing IAIS supervisory and supporting material on issues related to financial stability, systemic risk and macroprudential supervision. It assists its Members in developing enhanced macroprudential surveillance tools.\n\n\n=== Financial sector coordination ===\nThe IAIS coordinates its work with other standard-setting bodies, international financial policymakers and associations of supervisors or regulators. In particular, the IAIS is a member of the:\n\nFinancial Stability Board (FSB)\nMember of the Standards Advisory Council of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)The IAIS also participates as an observer or partner with numerous other organisations, including the Arab Union of Insurance Regulatory Commissions (AUIRC), Asian Forum of Insurance Regulators (AFIR), Association of Latin American Insurance Supervisors (ASSAL), Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), Financial Action Task Force (FATF), International Actuarial Association (IAA), International Organisation of Pension Supervisors (IOPS), Islamic Financial Services Board (IFSB), National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Group of International Insurance Centre Supervisors (GIICS), the Insurance and Private Pensions Committee (IPPC) of the Organisation for Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the G20/OECD Financial Consumer Protection Task Force.\nThe IAIS is also a founding partner of the Access to Insurance Initiative, a multi-stakeholder partnership with the mission to inspire and support insurance supervisors to promote inclusive and responsible insurance.\n\n\n=== Meetings and events ===\nThe IAIS holds Committee meetings three times a year, as well as subcommittee meetings as needed. At its June meetings, the IAIS hosts a Global Seminar offering insurance supervisors and stakeholders an opportunity to discuss current and globally significant matters impacting the insurance sector, as well as the IAIS\u2019 most recent activities.\nThe IAIS also holds an Annual Conference which is open to supervisors and stakeholders to discuss topical issues and progress on IAIS activities. In conjunction with this conference, it convenes an Annual General Meeting of Members where it conducts official business.\nDue to the COVID-19 crisis, all in-person meetings have been cancelled or replaced with virtual events through to the end of 2020.\n\n\n== Publications ==\nThe IAIS also regularly publishes supporting material in the form of Application Papers and Issues Papers. Recently published papers have covered a wide range of topics, including sustainability and climate risk, corporate governance, fair treatment of customers, cyber risk and Fintech.\nThe IAIS financial stability activities are supported by an annual publication of the Global Insurance Market Report (GIMAR). The GIMAR contains a general description of developments in the global insurance sector as well as the outcome of the IAIS annual global monitoring exercise, i.e. the IAIS assessment of systemic risk in the global insurance sector. Finally, it includes the outcomes of an annual survey on the global reinsurance market.The IAIS publishes a regular newsletter outlining recent and upcoming activities.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInsurance law\nBank regulation\nFinancial regulation\nJoint Forum\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nIAIS Website"}
{"title": "Portfolio insurance", "text": "Portfolio insurance is a hedging strategy developed to limit the losses an investor might face from a declining index of stocks without having to sell the stocks themselves. The technique was pioneered by Hayne Leland and Mark Rubinstein in 1976.  Since its inception, the portfolio insurance strategy has been dubiously marketed as a product (similar to an insurance policy).  However, this is a misnomer as it is not a policy and there is no insurer of last resort.    \nThis strategy involves selling futures of a stock index during periods of price declines.  The proceeds from the sale of the futures help to offset paper losses of the owned portfolio.  This is similar to buying a put option in that it allows an investor to preserve upside gains but limits downside risk.  Portfolio insurance is most commonly used by institutional investors when the market direction is uncertain or volatile. \nIn practice, a portfolio insurance strategy uses computer-based models to analyze an optimal level of stock-to-cash ratios in various stock market conditions.  Though the number of owned shares could stay the same, the total portfolio value changes with the market.  As the market drops, a portfolio insurer would increase cash levels by selling index futures, maintaining the target ratio.  Conversely, the same portfolio insurer might buy index futures when stock values rise.  This combination of buying and selling of index futures is done in an effort to maintain the proper stock-to-cash ratio demanded by the portfolio insurance model or strategy.\n\n\n== Contribution to the 1987 Stock Market Crash ==\nBoth portfolio insurance and index arbitrage are commonly cited as two types of computer program trading which contributed to the stock market crash of October 19, 1987, also known as Black Monday.Though there is no debate that these two programs played a role in the crash, there seems to have been at least some debate as to the magnitude of their influence.  Later analysis that year by a Committee of Inquiry under the Chicago Mercantile Exchange brought forth supporting evidence that the market selloff was more heavily influenced by larger forces such as mutual funds, broker-dealers, and individual shareholders.\nPortfolio insurance has been roundly criticized over time as having been oversold in terms of its ability to protect the investor deploying it as a protection strategy.  In its Preliminary Report, the Committee of Inquiry for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange outlined its criticism:\"[S]ome members of the Committee believe that the purveyors of so-called \"dynamic hedging\" oversold these programs by marketing them as \"insurance.\"  There is no reason to believe, however, that the use of portfolio insurance will diminish now that the limitations of the insurance concept have been demonstrated.\"In August of 2019, CNBC's Jim Cramer criticized portfolio insurance and the role it played during the 1987 crash.\n\n\n== See also ==\nConstant proportion portfolio insurance\nSecurities Investor Protection Corporation\nFinancial risk management \u00a7 Investment management\n\n\n== References =="}

This might involve, for example, establishing different market settings and environments to observe experimentally and analyze agents' behavior and the resulting characteristics of trading flows, information diffusion and aggregation, price setting mechanism and returns processes.\nFields to which experimental methods have been applied include corporate finance, asset pricing, financial econometrics, international finance, personal financial decision-making, macro-finance, banking and financial intermediation, capital markets, risk management and insurance, derivatives, quantitative finance, corporate governance and compensation, investments, market mechanisms, SME and microfinance and entrepreneurial finance. \nResearchers in experimental finance can study to what extent existing financial economics theory makes valid predictions and attempt to discover new principles on which theory can be extended.\nExperimental finance is a branch of experimental economics and its most common use lies in the field of behavioral finance.\n\n\n== History ==\nIn 1948, Chamberlin reported results of the first market experiment. Since then the acceptability, recognition, role, and methods of experimental economics have evolved. \nFrom the early 1980s on a similar pattern emerged in experimental finance.\nThe foundational work in experimental finance was the work of Forsythe, Palfrey and Plott (1980), Plott and Sunder (1982), and Smith, Suchanek and Williams (1988).\n\n\n== Scientific value ==\nFinancial economics has one of the most detailed and updated observational data available of all branches of economics. Consequently, finance is characterized by strong empirical traditions. Much analysis is done on data from stock exchanges including bids, asks, transaction prices, volume, etc. There is also data available from information services on actions and events that may influence markets. Data from these sources is not able to report on expectations, on which theory of financial markets is built. In experimental markets the researcher is able to know expectations, and control fundamental values, trading institutions, and market parameters such as available liquidity and the total stock of the asset. This gives the researcher the ability to know the price and other predictions of alternative theories. This creates the opportunity to do powerful tests on the robustness of theories which were not possible from field data, since there is little knowledge on the parameters and expectations from field data.\n\n\n== Advantages ==\nFinancial data analysis is based on data drawn from settings created for a purpose other than answering a specific research question. This results in the situation where any interpretation of the results may be challenged since it ignores other variables that have changed. Traditional data analysis issues include omitted-variables biases, self-selection biases, unobservable independent variables, and unobservable dependent variables.Properly designed experiments are able to avoid several problems:Omitted-variables bias: Multiple experiments can be created with settings that differ from one another in exactly one independent variable. This way all other variables of the setting are controlled, which eliminates alternative explanations for observed differences in the dependent variable.\nSelf-selection: By randomly assigning subjects to different treatment groups, the experimenters avoid issues caused by self-selection and are able to directly observe the changes in the dependent variable by changing by altering certain independent variables.\nUnobservable independent variables: Experimentalists can create experimental settings themselves. This makes them able to observe all variables. Traditional data analysis may not be able to observe some variables, but sometimes experimenters cannot directly elicit certain information from subjects either. Without directly knowing a certain independent variable, good experimental design can create measures that to a large extent reflects the unobservable independent variable and the problem is therefore avoided.\nUnobservable dependent variables: In traditional data studies, extracting the cause for the dependent variable to change may prove to be difficult. Experimentalists have the ability to create certain tasks that elicit the dependent variable.\n\n\n== Types of experiments ==\n\n\n=== Laboratory experiments ===\nLaboratory experiments are the most common form of experimentation. Here the idea is to construct a highly controlled setting in a laboratory. The use of lab experiments increased due to growing interest in issues such as economic cooperation, trust, and neuroeconomics. In this type of experiments, treatment is assigned randomly to a group of individuals in order to compare their economic actions and behavior to an untreated control group within the artificial laboratory environment. The ability to control the variables in the experiment provides for more accurate assessment of causality.\n\n\n=== Controlled field studies or randomized field experiments ===\nControlled field experiments also randomize treatments but do so in real world applications. Average effects on people's behavior can then be consistently estimated by comparing behavior before and after the allocation.\n\n\n=== Natural experiments ===\nA natural experiment happens when some feature of the real world is randomly changed which allows using the exogenous variation due to this change to study causal effects of an otherwise endogenous explanatory variable. Natural experiments are popular in economic and finance research since they offer intuitive interpretation of the underlying identifying assumptions and enable a broader audience to check their consistency, this compared to purely statistical identification.\n\n\n== Main findings ==\nExperimental methods in finance offer complementary methodologies that have allowed for the observation and manipulation of underlying determinants of prices, such as fundamental values or insider information. Experimental studies complement empirical work, particularly in the area of theory testing and development. Exploiting this experimental methodology has revealed some important findings over the past years. These findings could not have been reached by traditional field data analysis alone and are therefore experimental finance\u2019s main contributions to the field of finance:\nSecurity markets can aggregate and disseminate information (there are efficient markets), but this process is less effective as the information becomes less widely held and the number of information components that must be aggregated increases.\nBut this is not always the case (some of them are inefficient).\nWhen information dissemination occurs, it is rarely perfect or instantaneous. Learning takes time.\nMore information is not always better from the point of view of the individual trader. Only those insiders who are much better informed than others can outperform other traders.\nMarkets for longer-lived assets have a strong tendency to generate price bubbles and crashes, prolonged deviations from fundamental values.\nEmotions of traders play a role in generating bubbles in experimental asset markets.\nAsset mispricing has been largely associated with trader overconfidence.\nPrices as well as bids, offers, timing, etc., convey information. There are many channels for information flow.\nWell-functioning derivative markets can help to improve primary markets\u2019 efficiency.\nStatistical efficiency or inability to make money using past data does not mean informational efficiency. Not being able to earn abnormal returns from the market does not mean that the price is right.\n\n\n== See also ==\nExperimental economics\nBehavioral economics\nGame theory\nReplication crisis #In economics\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nSociety for Experimental Finance (SEF)"}
{"title": "Loss payee clause", "text": "A loss payee clause (or loss payable clause) is a clause in a contract of insurance that provides, in the event of payment being made under the policy in relation to the insured risk, that payment will be made to a third party rather than to the insured beneficiary of the policy.\nSuch clauses are common where the insured property is subject to a mortgage or other security interest and the mortgagee, usually a bank, requires the property be insured and that such a clause be included.\nAlthough such clauses are found in other areas of insurance, they are most common in maritime insurance in relation to insuring mortgaged vessels.\nAs a matter of practicality, such clauses are usually appended to the end of existing policies in a separate addendum, after being negotiated between the insurer and the mortgagee. A sample clause issued by Lloyd's of London states that This Loss Payee clause shall in no manner or wise be construed as a separate agreement between Underwriters and the Beneficiary but only as a simple appointment of the beneficiary by the Assured to receive payment as its interest may appear from any funds which Underwriters agree to pay to the Assured in the event of any loss or from any judgement granted to the Assured.\n\n\n== Sample clause ==\nIt is noted that, by an assignment in writing collateral to a first priority statutory ship mortgage (the \"Mortgage\"), [the shipowner] (the \"Owner\") assigned absolutely to [the bank] (the \"Assignee\") the benefit of this policy of insurance and all benefits of this policy, including all claims of any nature (including return of premiums) under this policy. Claims payable under this policy in respect of a total or constructive total or an arranged or agreed or compromised total loss or unrepaired damage and all claims which (in the reasonable opinion of the Assignee) are analogous thereto shall be payable to the Assignee up to the Assignee's mortgage interest. Subject thereto, all other claims, unless and until underwriters have received notice from the Assignee of a default under the Mortgage, in which event all claims under this policy shall be payable directly to the Assignee up to the amount of the Assignee's mortgage interest, shall be payable as follows:\na claim in respect of any one casualty where the aggregate claim against all insurers does not exceed $500,000 or the equivalent in any other currency, prior to adjustment for any franchise or deductible under the terms of the policy, shall be paid directly to the Owner for the repair, salvage or other charges involved or as a reimbursement if the Owner has fully repaired the damage and paid all of the salvage or other charges;\na claim in respect of any one casualty where the aggregate claim against all insurers exceeds $500,000 or the equivalent in any other currency prior to adjustment for any franchise or deductible under the terms of the policy, shall, subject to the prior written consent of the Assignee, be paid to the Owner as and when [the vessel] (the \"Vessel\") is restored to her former state and condition and the liability in respect of which the insurance loss is payable is discharged, and provided that [the insurers] (the \"Insurers\") may with such consent make payment on account of repairs in the course of being effected, but, in the absence of any such prior written consent shall be payable directly to the Assignee up to the Assignee's mortgage interest.  Notwithstanding the terms of this loss payable clause and notwithstanding notice of assignment, unless and until brokers receive notice from the Assignee to the contrary, brokers shall be empowered to arrange their proportion of any collision and/or salvage guarantee to be given in the event of bail being required in order to prevent the arrest of the Vessel or to secure the release of the Vessel from arrest following a casualty.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nLloyd's of London standard form loss payee clause"}
{"title": "Clean surplus accounting", "text": "The clean surplus accounting method provides elements of a forecasting model that yields price as a function of earnings, expected returns, and change in book value.\n\nThe theory's primary use is to estimate the value of a company\u2019s shares (instead of discounted dividend/cash flow approaches). The secondary use is to estimate the cost of capital, as an alternative to e.g. the CAPM. \nThe \"clean surplus\" is calculated by not including transactions with shareholders (such as dividends, share repurchases or share offerings) when calculating returns; whereas standard accounting for financial statements requires that the change in book value equal earnings minus dividends (net of capital changes).\n\n\n== Theory ==\nThe market value (MV) of the firm -- and hence security returns -- can be expressed in terms of balance sheet and income statement components, as below. This allows reading the firm's value directly from the balance sheet. The theory assumes ideal conditions. Here:\n\nThe market value of a firm = net book value of the firm\u2019s net assets + present value of future abnormal earnings (goodwill).Logic:Goodwill is calculated as the difference between actual earnings  and expected earnings (\"abnormal earnings\").\nActual earnings are the \u201cclean surplus\u201d - this ensures that all gains or losses go through the income statement. The impact of fair values is recognized in earnings.\nExpected earnings = opening shareholders' equity X the firm\u2019s cost of capital (similar to accretion of discount.)\nFinally, convert book value to market value as above: firm value = net worth of the firm + calculated estimate of firm\u2019s goodwill.\n\n\n=== Applicability ===\nThis approach provides a relatively \"quick and dirty\" method to calculate the market value of a firm - which should be (approximately) the same as a valuation based on discounted dividends or cash flows.  \nThe model provides one estimate of the firm\u2019s shares, useful for comparison to their market value. Research by Frankel & Lee shows that this ratio provides a good predictor of share returns for 2\u20133 years into the future.\nThe model is applicable when abnormal earnings do not \"persist\" (i.e. no goodwill); in this case all gains and losses go through the income statement, and the firm's fair value appears on the balance sheet. \nThe investor can then calculate expected earnings directly from the balance sheet, as above. \nHowever, if persistence is assumed, the income statement will have emerging \"information content\": this increases the impact of the income statement on firm value, and the method is less applicable. \n(Greater persistence similarly translates to a greater Earnings response coefficient.)\n\n\n== See also ==\nValuation (finance) #Net asset value method\nResidual income valuation\nT-model\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAccounting for dirty surplus\nWhat is clean surplus"}
{"title": "Fixed income analysis", "text": "Fixed income analysis is the process of determining the value of a debt security based on an assessment of its risk profile, which can include interest rate risk, risk of the issuer failing to repay the debt, market supply and demand for the security, call provisions and macroeconomic considerations affecting its value in the future. It also addresses the likely price behavior in hedging portfolios. Based on such an analysis, a fixed income analyst tries to reach a conclusion as to whether to buy, sell, hold, hedge or avoid the particular security.\nFixed income products are generally bonds: debt instruments requiring the issuer (i.e. the debtor or borrower) to repay the lender the amount borrowed (principal) plus interest over a specified period of time (coupon payments) until maturity. They are issued by government treasuries, government agencies, companies or international organizations.\n\n\n== Calculating Value ==\nTo determine the value of a fixed income security, the analyst must estimate the expected cash flows from the investment and the appropriate required yield. The cash flows consist of:\n\nperiodic interest (known as coupon) payments prior to the maturity date, and\nthe repayment of the principal at par value upon maturity.The required yield is determined by investigating the yield offered on securities of comparable risk in the market. The required yield is applied to the expected cash flows to estimate their present value, which equals the security's value.\n\n\n== Analysis ==\n \nKey factors considered in fixed income analysis include the following: \n\nWhat is the appropriate yield premium for the security being analyzed compared to a U.S. Treasury security of the same maturity, and how does that compare to the yield premium reflected in the actual market price? Is the premium built into the yield enough to compensate for the risks? The factors that affect the yield premium include:the type of issuer,\nthe issuer's perceived creditworthiness,\nthe potential impact of any embedded options, such as a call feature, which permit either the bondholder or the issuer to alter the cash flows,\nthe relationship between the market yield on bonds of the same credit quality but different maturities (known as the term structure of interest rates, or yield curve)\nthe taxability of the interest received by investors, and\nthe expected liquidity of the security. Demand comes from banks, insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds, endowment organisations, external government treasuries, and individual investors such as retirees who need predictable cash flows from their investments.What are the new or hidden risks the market has overlooked and to what extent?\nIs inflation expected to worsen or improve?\nDoes the real interest rate built into the yield make sense? Is the real interest rate in line with the expected GDP growth rate (in case of treasury bonds) or earnings growth rate (in case of corporate bonds)?\nWhere do we stand in the business cycle of the particular company, or economic cycle of the particular country?\nIs there any change expected in the basic real interest rate in the near future? Will the prevailing monetary and economic conditions force any monetary easing or tightening?\nAre the financial authorities in the country pro-active or re-active to the forces of inflation and economic conditions?The approaches for analysing fixed income products include the fundamental approach, the technical approach, and the relative value approach.\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nColin, Dr Andrew.

{"title": "Specific risk", "text": "In finance, a specific risk is a risk that affects a very small number of assets. This is sometimes referred to as \"unsystematic risk\". In a balanced portfolio of assets there would be a spread between general market risk and risks specific to individual components of that portfolio. Determination of the extent of exposure to individual risks is made using models such as Treynor-Black in which the optimal share of a security is inversely proportional to the square of its specific risk.An example would be news that is specific to either one stock or a group of companies, such as the loss of a patent or a major natural disaster affecting the company's operation.\nUnlike systematic risk or market risk, specific risk can be diversified away. In fact, most unsystematic risk is removed by holding a portfolio of about twenty-five to thirty securities.\n\n\n== References =="}

In the first case, CVRs are granted \n \nin scenarios in which the acquiring company does not wish to pay for a product that might not work, has a limited market, or might need significant investment;\nwhereas on the other side, the acquired company \u201cwants to get full value for its assets\u201d.\nThe CVR then \u201chelps bridge this negotiation\u201d.\nUnder these rights, shareholders will receive additional cash, securities, or benefits if a specific and named event occurs \n- one where the value of the firm significantly increases\n- within a specified timeframe. \nCVRs are common in the biotech and pharmaceutical industries \n(see Valuation (finance) \u00a7 Valuation of intangible assets); \nthey are also often granted to shareholders in companies facing significant,  value accretive restructuring. \nFor an example see Media General / Nexstar Media Group.\nIn the second case, protection against price risk is facilitated by specifying that payment will be made at an averaged, as opposed to final, share price; a floor may also be set. \n\n\n== Valuation ==\nUnder both, the CVR is in function, a form of option.\nThe first case: analogous to a call option, the payout to the CVR holder will be triggered by the event occurring, and will be zero otherwise.\nTo determine the value of these rights, \nanalysts will apply a modified option pricing model based on the probability of the event, the time horizon specified, and the corresponding payout rules; \nsee Contingent claim valuation, Real options valuation, and Mergers and acquisitions \u00a7 Business valuation.\nThe second: the CVR takes the form of a modified Asian option.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStrip financing\nHold-up problem\nEarnout\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCVR on Investopedia\nCVR on Motley Fool\nShadowy Shares: The Dark Side of Contingent Value Rights, Forbes.com  (Michael Stocker, Iona Evan. 2011)"}
{"title": "Extended coverage", "text": "Extended coverage is a term used in the property insurance business. All insurance policies have exclusions for specific causes of loss (also called \"perils\") that are not covered by the insurance company.  An extended coverage endorsement (EC) was a common extension of property insurance beyond coverage for fire and lightning. Extended coverage added insurance against loss by the perils of windstorm, hail, explosion, civil commotion, riot and riot attending a strike, aircraft damage, vehicle damage, and smoke damage.The endorsement has been largely supplanted by what is referred to as \"basic\" causes-of-loss form first introduced by Insurance Services Office in 1986 as part of its simplified language revisions. The basic form includes most of the perils previously provided by fire and extended coverage and it adds vandalism and malicious mischief, sprinkler leakage damage, sinkhole collapse, and volcanic action. Coverage can also be extended on scheduled personal articles or applied as extensions to personal umbrella liability or extended title.\nBroader coverage is available in \"broad form\" and \"special form\" causes-of-loss forms. Broad form adds three additional perils plus collapse due to certain causes. Special form covers almost all risks of loss except those that are specifically excluded.\nThere are many types of extended coverage and this is only a partial list Types of Extended Insurance Coverage\n\nPersonal Umbrella Liability \u2013 You can add between $1 million to $5 million of liability coverage over and above your current policy limits, and with no deductible. While this is a valuable addition to your Home policy, the extended liability coverage also applies to your auto, seasonal, watercraft policies and more\nFlood Insurance \u2013 You may be particularly interested if you live in an area prone to flooding like near the coast because floods caused by hurricanes are usually not covered\nHailstorm \u2013 Unless hail is explicitly covered by your basic homeowners policy (obviously particularly where hail is commonplace)\nEarthquake \u2013 This is usually only partially covered, or not at all by a conventional policy\nExtended Title \u2013 is an extended coverage because there are many things not covered by basic title insurance policies\nMedical \u2013 Covers illnesses and lengths of stay not covered by the basic medical or health care policy\nDental \u2013 will help pay for some or partially covered dental surgeries\nEscape of fuel oil \u2013 If you use oil to heat your home, this optional insurance covers you for damages caused by oil leaking from your tank\nWater \u2013 Insures sewer backup and other water damage caused by overflow of outside drains or sewers\nScheduled personal articles \u2013 Special limits are set on items like jeweler or fine arts.

{"title": "LBO valuation model", "text": "The LBO (or leveraged buyout) valuation model estimates the current value of a business to a \"financial buyer\", based on the business's forecast financial performance. An already-completed five-year financial forecast and two assumptions are all that are necessary to create a first draft of a comprehensive LBO valuation of the business.\nFrom a processing standpoint, the model makes a copy of the already completed five-year forecast and uses that copy (and any changes made to it) for projecting future operating results. As such, the original forecast is preserved.\nThe model analyzes the value of a business from the point of view of a \"financial buyer\" who owns no other businesses in that industry and, therefore, expects all of its investment return to result solely from the future operations of the business. The LBO valuation model assumes that the buyer has investigated a business and operating plan and believes the business will achieve the financial results that have been forecast.\nFrom a timing standpoint, the LBO valuation model assumes that the financial buyer intends to purchase the business at the beginning of year two of a five-year forecast and intends to own the business for the ensuing four years, and then sell the business.\nIn order to generalize the analysis across a potentially infinite range of \"deal\" attributes, the model assumes the financial buyer is buying only the assets of the business and assuming none of its liabilities. Therefore, the seller of the business needs to pay off all of the liabilities of the business (and in all likelihood, any tax owed as a result of the gain realized on the sale of the assets) from the purchase price paid by the financial buyer.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nLBO Valuation Model, Corporate Finance Network, retrieved 2009-02-12"}
{"title": "Gap financing", "text": "Gap Financing is a term mostly associated with mortgage loans or property loans such as a bridge loan. It is an interim loan given to finance the difference between the floor loan and the maximum permanent loan as committed.\nMore specifically, gap financing is subordinated temporary financing paid off when the first mortgagee disburses the full amount due under the first mortgage loan. This is normal in a situation involving a permanent \u201cfloor-ceiling loan,\u201d where the borrower does not meet a rent-roll requirement, and the first mortgagee funds only a floor amount, agreeing to fund the balance in the event the rent-roll requirement is met within a stated period. In this case, the gap lender is often the construction lender. Where the gap lender has agreed prior to construction to make the gap loan, the document that ties together the construction loan, the gap loan, and the permanent loan is the buy-sell agreement. In this agreement, a special provision is inserted providing that if the permanent lender's rent-roll holdback is not fulfilled at the time for the permanent closing, the construction lender agrees to disburse, at a concurrent closing date, funds equal to the amount withheld by the permanent lender pursuant to its commitment. These gap funds are normally evidenced by a promissory note secured by a junior mortgage subject and subordinate in all respects to the permanent loan documentation. The gap documents usually state unequivocally that, in the event the rent-roll requirement is not met during the rent-roll period, the permanent lender still retains the right on demand to purchase the gap note and discharge of record any second mortgage held by the construction lender. The borrower normally assigns to the construction lender all funds that would otherwise be payable to the borrower in the event the rent-roll requirement is met, with the construction lender agreeing to reassign to the borrower all funds that would be payable pursuant to the rent-roll requirement at such time as the gap loan note is paid in full. In addition, the permanent lender usually requires that the temporary lender and borrower agree that no funds will be disbursed under the gap documents, except at the closing of the permanent loan.\nNormally, the permanent lender's rent-roll requirement involves a period that runs from one to three years. However, the promissory note for the gap loan should be predicated on the possibility that the rent-roll requirement may not be met, and the terms should include a period of four to five years beyond the rent-roll requirement period, with a high enough interest rate to prompt the developer to refinance whenever it becomes feasible to do so. With regard to principal amortization, some gap lenders require none, while others require either partial amortization or amortization to the extent that there is net cash flow to be derived from the project.\nBecause of its prior position as construction lender, the gap lender usually has sufficient leverage with the permanent lender to receive adequate notice provisions and a right-to-cure period from the permanent lender.\nGap financing can also be used in purchase/rehab lending to fill the \"gap\" between the borrower's down payment, and the amount lent by the 1st lien holder, or rehab lender. Typically rehab lenders will only go to 65-70% ARV (After Repair Value), so if the borrower is bringing 10% into the deal, the gap funder would provide the other 20-25%, and take a 2nd position lien and often a portion of the profit.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Investment performance", "text": "Investment performance is the return on an investment portfolio.  The investment portfolio can contain a single asset or multiple assets.  The investment performance is measured over a specific period of time and in a specific currency. \nInvestors often distinguish different types of return.  One is the distinction between the total return and the price return, where the former takes into account income (interest and dividends), whereas the latter only takes into account capital appreciation.\nAnother distinction is between net and gross return.  The 'pure' net return to the investor is the return inclusive of all fees, expenses, and taxes, whereas the 'pure' gross return is the return before all fees, expenses, and taxes.  As a result, gross returns will be greater than net returns.  Various variations between these two extremes exist.  Which return one looks at depends on what one is trying to measure.  For example, if one wishes to measure the ability of an investment manager to add value, then the return net of transaction expenses, but gross of all other fees, expenses, and taxes is an appropriate measure to look at since fees, expenses, and taxes other than transaction expenses are often outside the control of the investment manager.\nAnother important distinction is between the money-weighted return and the time-weighted return.  The former is appropriate if the manager determines the timing of inflows in or outflows from the portfolio.  The latter is appropriate when the manager is not responsible for the timing of cash inflows into and cash outflows from the portfolio.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAbsolute investment performance, Absolute return\nFinancial risk management \u00a7 Investment management\nHolding period return\nModified Dietz Method\nInternal Rate of Return\nRate of return\nRelative return\nRisk-adjusted return on capital\nSimple Dietz Method\nTime-weighted return\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBruce J.

{"title": "Legal origins theory", "text": "The legal origins theory claims that the two main legal traditions or origins, civil law and common law, crucially shape lawmaking and dispute adjudication and have not been reformed after the initial exogenous transplantation by Europeans. Therefore, they affect economic outcomes to date. According to the evidence reported by the initial proponents of such a theory, countries that received civil law would display today less secure investor rights, stricter regulation, and more inefficient governments and courts than those that inherited common law. These differences would reflect both a stronger historical emphasis of common law on private ordering and the higher adaptability of judge-made law.\n\n\n== Colonial Transplantation and Main Structural Differences ==\nWhile English common law originated in thirteenth century England and has then been transplanted through colonization and occupation to England\u2019s ex-colonies (United States, Canada, Australia, and several countries in Central America, Africa and Asia), the Scandinavian common law was developed in Denmark and Sweden and the German common law sprang in Germany and Switzerland.  These last four countries then exported their common law model to the respective colonies or to those jurisdictions (China, Greece, Japan, Romania, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Turkey), which were never colonized but borrowed their initial legal order from the European codes considered most advanced at the time.\nCivil law instead has its roots in Roman law, was incorporated by the Napoleonic codes first and then by both the Austrian and Russian Civil codes, and has been then introduced via mainly colonization and occupation into continental Europe, the Near East, Latin America, Africa, and Indochina. Bulgaria, Ethiopia, Iran, and Kazakhstan instead purposely borrowed their initial legal order from either France, Russia, or England.\nStructurally, the two legal traditions constitute a well-defined bundle of lawmaking and adjudication institutions and operate in quite different ways [Merryman 1969, p. 52, 123\u2013127; Zweigert and K\u00f6tz 1998, p. 272]. While common law entrusts a key role to the precedents selected by appellate judges and allows more procedural discretion to lower adjudicating courts, civil law relies on legal codes designed by political representatives and bright-line adjudication rules.\n\n\n== Early Empirical Evidence ==\nIn a series of influential papers published between 1997 and 2008, Rafael La Porta, Florencio Lopez-de-Silanes, Andrei Shleifer, and Robert Vishny exploited the exogenous assignment of these very different institutions and assumed that they have not been reformed later on to provide evidence consistent with the idea that common law is correlated with:\"(a) better investor protection, which in turn is associated with improved financial development [\u2026], (b) lighter government ownership and regulation, which are in turn associated with less corruption, better functioning labor markets, and smaller unofficial economies, and (c) less formalized and more independent judicial systems, which are in turn associated with more secure property rights and better contract enforcement.\" Operationally, the \"legal origins\" scholars assigned the majority of countries in the world to either the English-common law, the French-civil law, or one among the German, Scandinavian, and Socialist legal traditions and then they calculated correlations between these legal origins dummies and proxies for the aforementioned economic outcomes.\n\n\n== Theoretical Justification to the Putative Primacy of Common Law ==\nThe \"legal origins\" scholars suggest that common law has at least two favorable consequences. First, historical events in England and in France built into the common law a stronger emphasis on the independence of the judiciary, private ordering, and human capital. Second, judge-made law would make common law more adaptable to the contracting needs of the economy.\n\n\n=== Historical Emphasis of Common Law on Private Ordering ===\nEdward Glaeser and Andrei Shleifer contend that the development of a system of adjudication by lay juries in England and one of adjudication by professional judges in France were conscious choices reflecting the different political power of the English and French barons during the 12th century. \"The former were concerned about the powerful English king\u2019s ability to interfere in adjudication and bargained for trial by local, lay juries, a right enshrined in Magna Carta. The relatively weak French crown, by contrast, was less a threat than other barons. French barons accordingly desired a centralized adjudication system controlled by royal judges who would not be easily captured by local interests.\"Napoleon\u2019s attempt to turn through its codes the judiciary into bureaucrats controlled by the State and the post-1688 Glorious Revolution success of the English judiciary in establishing its independence should have reinforced these dissimilarities, instilling at the same time into the common law a stronger emphasis on judicial independence and on private ordering. This divergence would imply that common law will always shore up markets and the civil law will always restrict markets or replace them with state command.This analysis of the medieval European history has been criticized by Daniel Klerman and Paul Mahoney, who conclude that a system of adjudication by lay juries was initially favored in England because of low literacy levels and later enforced to place the judicial power in the hands of the crown. They argue that both French and English judiciaries had the de facto power to make law through precedent, and that French judges enjoyed a greater independence because their office could be inherited as property. Hence, the only permanent divergence between the legal orders in England and in France originated from the different fortunes of the judiciary in the aftermath of their respective revolutions.\n\n\n=== Adaptability of Judge-made Law ===\nThe key institution differentiating the two legal traditions is the lawmaking institution, which determines the identity of the lawmaker. Common law relies on case law, whereby precedents set by appellate courts guide subsequent adjudication by courts of the same or lower standing and can be changed by appellate judges only with a costly justification effort. Civil law instead relies on statute law, which comprises legislation enacted by political representatives.\"Legal origins\" scholars identify three main advantages of judge-made law compared with statute law:\n\nSince overruling is costly, precedents tend to include both the deciding appellate judge\u2019s opinion and those of the preceding appellate judges in such a way that the long-run law optimally incorporates the different opinions of all appellate judges, whereas statute law can be permanently biased by special interests.\nAppellate judges can effectively introduce new information into the law by distinguishing the precedent.\nSince inefficient rules tend to be appealed more often, they should be evaluated more often by appellate judges than by politicians.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nGennaioli, Nicola; Shleifer, Andrei (2007). \"Overruling and the Instability of Law\".

{"title": "Consumer credit risk", "text": "The following article is based on UK market; other countries may differ.\n\nConsumer credit risk (also retail credit risk) is the risk of loss due to a consumer's failure or inability to repay (default) on a consumer credit product, such as a mortgage, unsecured personal loan, credit card, overdraft etc. (the latter two options being forms of unsecured banking credit).\n\n\n== Consumer credit risk management ==\nMost companies involved in lending to consumers have departments dedicated to the measurement, prediction and control of losses due to credit risk. This field is loosely referred to consumer/retail credit risk management, however, the word management is commonly dropped.\n\n\n=== Scorecards ===\n\nA common method for predicting credit risk is through the credit scorecard. The scorecard is a statistically based model for attributing a number (score) to a customer (or an account) which indicates the predicted probability that the customer will exhibit a certain behaviour. In calculating the score, a range of data sources may be used, including data from an application form, from credit reference agencies or from products the customer already holds with the lender.\nThe most widespread type of scorecard in use is the application scorecard, which lenders employ when a customer applies for a new credit product. The scorecard tries to predict the probability that the customer, if given the product, would become \"bad\" within a given timeframe, incurring losses for the lender. The exact definition of what constitutes \"bad\" varies across different lenders, product types and target markets, however, examples may be \"missing three payments within the next 18 months\" or \"default within the next 12 months\". The score given to a customer is usually a three or four digit integer, and in most cases is proportional to the natural logarithm of the odds (or logit) of the customer becoming \"bad\". In general, a low score indicates a low quality (a high chance of going \"bad\") and a high score indicates the opposite.\nOther scorecard types may include behavioural scorecards - which try to predict the probability of an existing account turning \"bad\"; propensity scorecards - which try to predict the probability that a customer would accept another product if offered one; and collections scorecards - which try to predict a  customer's response to different strategies for collecting owed money.\n\n\n=== Credit strategy ===\nCredit strategy is concerned with turning predictions of customer behavior (as provided by scorecards) into a decision whether to accept their business.\nTo turn an application score into a Yes/No decision, \"cut-offs\" are generally used. A cut-off is a score at and above which customers have their application accepted and below which applications are declined. The placement of the cut-off is closely linked to the price (annual percentage rate \u2013 APR) that the lender is charging for the product. The higher the price charged, the greater the losses the lender can endure and still remain profitable. So, with a higher price the lender can accept customers with a higher probability of going \"bad\" and can move the cut-off down. The opposite is true of a lower price. Most lenders go further and charge low scoring customers a higher APR than high scoring customers. This compensates for the added risk of taking on poorer quality business without affecting the lender's place in the market with better quality borrowers. In the UK, lenders must advertise a typical rate, which at least 51% of customers must receive.\nApplication score is also used as a factor in deciding such things as an overdraft or credit card limit. Lenders are generally happier to extend a larger limit to higher scoring customers than to lower scoring customers, because they are more likely to pay borrowings back.\nAlongside scorecards lie policy rules which apply regulatory requirements (such as making sure there is no lending to under 18s) and other lending policy (such as many lenders will not lend to customers who have a County Court judgment (CCJ) registered against them).\nCredit Strategy is also concerned with the ongoing management of a customer's account, especially with revolving credit products such as credit cards, overdrafts and flexible loans, where the customer's balance can go up as well as down. Behavioural scorecards are used (usually monthly) to provide an updated picture of the credit-quality of the customer/account. As the customer's profile changes, the lender may choose to extend or contract the customer's limits.\n\n\n=== Underwriting ===\nNot all decisions can be made automatically through the methods mentioned above. This may be for a number of reasons; insufficient data, regulatory requirements, or a borderline decision. In such cases highly trained professionals called underwriters manually review the case and make a decision. Sometimes this is done in conjunction with the \"cut-offs\" mentioned above and the data provided by scoring. This is more common in highly regulated products such as mortgages, especially when large sums are involved.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCredit scorecards\nCredit risk\n\n\n== References ==\n\nMurray Bailey, Consumer Credit Quality: Underwriting, Scoring, Fraud Prevention and Collections\nDavid Lawrence and Arlene Solomon, Managing a Consumer Lending Business\nAnthea Wynn and Helen McNab,  Principles and Practice of Consumer Credit Risk Management"}
{"title": "Deterministic global optimization", "text": "Deterministic global optimization is a branch of numerical optimization which focuses on finding the global solutions of an optimization problem whilst providing theoretical guarantees that the reported solution is indeed the global one, within some predefined tolerance. The term \"deterministic global optimization\" typically refers to complete or rigorous (see below) optimization methods. Rigorous methods converge to the global optimum in finite time. Deterministic global optimization methods are typically used when locating the global solution is a necessity (i.e. when the only naturally occurring state described by a mathematical model is the global minimum of an optimization problem), when it is extremely difficult to find a feasible solution, or simply when the user  desires to locate the best possible solution to a problem.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nNeumaier classified global optimization methods in four categories, depending on their degree of rigour with which they approach the optimum, as follows:\n\nAn incomplete method uses clever intuitive heuristics for searching but has no safeguards if the search gets stuck in a local minimum\nAn asymptotically complete method reaches a global minimum with certainty or at least with probability one if allowed to run indefinitely long, but has no means to know when a global minimizer has been found.\nA complete method reaches a global minimum with certainty, assuming exact computations and indefinitely long run time, and knows after a finite time that an approximate global minimizer has been found (to within prescribed tolerances).\nA rigorous method reaches a global minimum with certainty and within given tolerances even in the presence of rounding errors, except in near-degenerate cases, where the tolerances may be exceeded.Deterministic global optimization methods typically belong to the last two categories. Note that building a rigorous piece of software is extremely difficult as the process requires that all the dependencies are also coded rigorously.\nDeterministic global optimization methods require ways to rigorously bound function values over regions of space. One could say that a main difference between deterministic and non-deterministic methods in this context is that the former perform calculations over regions of the solution space, whereas the latter perform calculations on single points. This is either done by exploiting particular functional forms (e.g. McCormick relaxations), or using interval analysis in order to work with more general functional forms. In any case bounding is required, which is why deterministic global optimization methods cannot give a rigorous result when working with black-box code, unless that code is explicitly written to also return function bounds. For this reason, it is common for problems in deterministic global optimization to be represented using a computational graph, as it is straightforward to overload all operators such that the resulting function values or derivatives yield interval (rather than scalar) results.\n\n\n== Classes of deterministic global optimization problems ==\n\n\n=== Linear programming problems (LP) ===\nLinear programming problems are a highly desirable formulation for any practical problem. The reason is that, with the rise of interior-point algorithms, it is possible to efficiently solve very large problems (involving hundreds of thousands or even millions of variables) to global optimality. Linear programming optimization problems strictly fall under the category of deterministic global optimization.\n\n\n=== Mixed-integer linear programming problems (MILP) ===\nMuch like linear programming problems, MILPs are very important when solving decision-making models. Efficient algorithms for solving complex problems of this type are known and are available in the form of solvers such as CPLEX.\n\n\n=== Non-linear programming problems (NLP) ===\nNon-linear programming problems are extremely challenging in deterministic global optimization. The order of magnitude that a modern solver can be expected to handle in reasonable time is roughly 100 to a few hundreds of non-linear variables. At the time of this writing, there exist no parallel solvers for the deterministic solution of NLPs, which accounts for the complexity gap between deterministic LP and NLP programming.\n\n\n=== Mixed-integer non-linear programming problems (MINLP) ===\nEven more challenging than their NLP counterparts, deterministically solving an MINLP problem can be very difficult. Techniques such as integer cuts, or branching a problem on its integer variables (hence creating NLP sub-problems which can in turn be solved deterministically), are commonly used.\n\n\n== Zero-order methods ==\nZero-order methods consist of methods which make use of zero-order interval arithmetic. A representative example is interval bisection.\n\n\n== First-order methods ==\nFirst-order methods consist of methods which make use of first-order information, e.g., interval gradients or interval slopes.\n\n\n== Second-order methods ==\nSecond-order methods make use of second-order information, usually eigenvalue bounds derived from interval Hessian matrices. One of the most general second-order methodologies for handling problems of general  type is the \u03b1\u0392\u0392 algorithm.\n\n\n== Deterministic global optimization solvers ==\nANTIGONE: Algorithms for coNTinuous / Integer Global Optimization of Nonlinear Equations).

{"title": "Core & Satellite", "text": "Core & Satellite Portfolio Management is an investment strategy that incorporates traditional fixed-income and equity-based securities (i.e. index funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), passive mutual funds, etc.) known as the \"core\" portion of the portfolio, with a percentage of selected individual securities in the fixed-income and equity-based side of the portfolio known as the \"satellite\" portion.\n\n\n== Core portfolio ==\nThe \"Core\" is made of passively managed securities (e.g. index funds, ETFs, passive mutual funds, individual securities) and uses a traditional benchmark (e.g. Russell 3000 or the S&P 1500) to benchmark/compare for performance.  The positions may have a particular style bias (e.g.  more small cap stocks over mid/large cap companies, more value positions over growth positions, higher or lower concentration in developed international markets) and is sometimes consistent with the MONECO Seven Asset Allocation Management Theme.  The market downturn of 2008 has many experts in the investments industry questioning the validity of asset allocation as a means for diversifying and managing overall risks associated with investing in stocks.  As a consequence, other alternatives are now gaining force.  Owning a core equity portfolio centered on a theme of dividend growth continues to gain momentum as individuals are faced with a growing likelihood of outliving their investable assets.  With a core centered on dividend growth, individuals create a growing income stream irrespective of the account value associated with growth in the underlying assets.\n\n\n== Satellite portfolio ==\nThe \"Satellite\" portion, by contrast, comprises holdings that the advisor expects will add alpha, the financial term for returns exceeding systematic. Holdings may include actively managed stocks, mutual funds, and separate account managers with a particular sector, region of positions, or Micro or Mega Cap Company Holdings, or passively managed assets with a particular style that is counter to, or even enhances, the style bias of the core. Short holding periods and tax-inefficient positions may result in short-term capital gains or losses.\nIf the entire allotment of the satellite portion is not deemed worthy of inclusion, that portion will either be reallocated across \"core\" positions or in a \"satellite holder\"\u2014a position that mirrors some aspect of the core (generally the position most closely resembling the benchmark) that is quickly traded when an opportunity is identified without causing major tax implications (e.g., issues with FIFO based trades).\nThis satellite allocation may be implemented into 100% equity allocations and/or allocations that blend with fixed-income or non-equity positions. The satellite portfolio may be used occasionally for fixed-income investing (emerging market debt, junk bonds, individual bonds) but generally it is dedicated to: equities and alternative assets such as: hedge funds, REITs, commodities, options, and foreign currencies. Principal protected notes may also be used; these investments are truly hybrid in that they provide a guaranteed return of principal while providing upside participation in a number of equity and alternative-investments asset classes.\nPortfolios are more than a collection of financial assets and the satellite investments must be selected and managed considering the portfolio as a whole. The satellite should improve not only the return but the risk/return profile of the portfolio, and not only quantitatively (the Sharpe ratio or whatever other risk/return measures used) but also qualitatively, by adding sources of value (e.g. non-correlated strategies, short and medium-term investment ideas, risk-asymmetric assets, etc.) different from that in the core but still consistent with the market and economic view and the client's financial planning goals.\n\n\n== Theory of this investment style ==\nIn some efficient markets, active management has lower returns than passive management. Also, market timing by the investor could potentially cause damage to returns.\nActive management by an individual investor of \"core\" positions could underperform passive management after taxes and expenses in real return performance. However, the investor may gain some psychological benefit from changing their allocation. Since the \"satellite\" portfolio contains only a small portion of the overall portfolio (i.e. the core and satellite portfolio combined), this psychological benefit can be gained while keeping most of the portfolio in passive management.\nThe theory/key of the \"Core/Satellite\" management style is that by design and active management, it limits the taxes and the expenses inside the core holding while the 'potential return lost' from passive management is significantly offset by the strong correlation in return to large equity indexes. Additional returns, held within the satellite portfolio, come from assets with projected future returns in excess of the core benchmarks of the core portfolio after taxes, inflation and expenses.\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Quantitative behavioral finance", "text": "Quantitative behavioral finance is a new discipline that uses mathematical and statistical methodology to understand behavioral biases in conjunction with valuation. \nThe research can be grouped into the following areas:\n\nEmpirical studies that demonstrate significant deviations from classical theories.\nModeling using the concepts of behavioral effects together with the non-classical assumption of the finiteness of assets.\nForecasting based on these methods.\nStudies of experimental asset markets and use of models to forecast experiments.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe prevalent theory of financial markets during the second half of the 20th century has been the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) which states that all public information is incorporated into asset prices. Any deviation from this true price is quickly exploited by informed traders who attempt to optimize their returns and it restores the true equilibrium price. For all practical purposes, then, market prices behave as though all traders were pursuing their self-interest with complete information and rationality.\nToward the end of the 20th century, this theory was challenged in several ways. First, there were a number of large market events that cast doubt on the basic assumptions. On October 19, 1987 the Dow Jones average plunged over 20% in a single day, as many smaller stocks suffered deeper losses. The large oscillations on the ensuing days provided a graph that resembled the famous crash of 1929. The crash of 1987 provided a puzzle and challenge to most economists who had believed that such volatility should not exist in an age when information and capital flows are much more efficient than they were in the 1920s.\nAs the decade continued, the Japanese market soared to heights that were far from any realistic assessment of the valuations. Price-earnings ratios soared to triple digits, as Nippon Telephone and Telegraph achieved a market valuation (stock market price times the number of shares) that exceeded the entire market capitalization of West Germany.  In early 1990 the Nikkei index stood at 40,000, having nearly doubled in two years.  In less than a year the Nikkei dropped to nearly half its peak.\nMeanwhile, in the US the growth of new technology, particularly the internet, spawned a new generation of high tech companies, some of which became publicly traded long before any profits. As in the Japanese stock market bubble a decade earlier these stocks soared to market valuations of billions of dollars sometimes before they even had revenue. The bubble continued into 2000 and the consequent bust reduced many of these stocks to a few percent of their prior market value. Even some large and profitable tech companies lost 80% of their value during the period 2000-2003.\nThese large bubbles and crashes in the absence of significant changes in valuation cast doubt on the assumption of efficient markets that incorporate all public information accurately. In his book, \u201cIrrational Exuberance\u201d, Robert Shiller discusses the excesses that have plagued markets, and concludes that stock prices move in excess of changes in valuation. This line of reasoning has also been confirmed in several studies (e.g., Jeffrey Pontiff ), of closed-end funds which trade like stocks, but have a precise valuation that is reported frequently. (See Seth Anderson and Jeffrey Born \u201cClosed-end Fund Pricing\u201d   for review of papers relating to these\nissues.)\nIn addition to these world developments, other challenges to classical economics and EMH came from the new field of experimental economics pioneered by Vernon L. Smith who won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. These experiments (in collaboration with Gerry Suchanek, Arlington Williams and David Porter and others) featuring participants trading an asset defined by the experimenters on a network of computers. A series of experiments involved a single asset which pays a fixed dividend during each of 15 periods and then becomes worthless. Contrary to the expectations of classical economics, trading prices often soar to levels much higher than the expected payout. Similarly, other experiments showed that many of the expected results of classical economics and game theory are not borne out in experiments. A key part of these experiments is that participants earn real money as a consequence of their trading decisions, so that the experiment is an actual market rather than a survey of opinion.\nBehavioral finance (BF) is a field that has grown during the past two decades in part as a reaction to the phenomena described above. Using a variety of methods researchers have documented systematic biases (e.g., underreaction, overreaction, etc.) that occur among professional investors as well as novices. Behavioral finance researchers generally do not subscribe to EMH as a consequence of these biases. However, EMH theorists counter that while EMH makes a precise prediction about a market based upon the data, BF usually does not go beyond saying that EMH is wrong.\n\n\n== Research in Quantitative Behavioral Finance ==\nThe attempt to quantify basic biases and to use them in mathematical models is the subject of Quantitative Behavioral Finance. Caginalp and collaborators have used both statistical and mathematical methods on both the world market data and experimental economics data in order to make quantitative predictions. In a series of papers dating back to 1989, Caginalp and collaborators have studied asset market dynamics using differential equations that incorporate strategies and biases of investors such as the price trend and valuation within a system that has finite cash and asset. This feature is distinct from classical finance in which there is the assumption of infinite arbitrage.\nOne of the predictions of this theory by Caginalp and Balenovich (1999)  was that a larger supply of cash per share would result in a larger bubble. Experiments by Caginalp, Porter and Smith (1998)  confirmed that doubling the level of cash, for example, while maintaining constant number of shares essentially doubles the magnitude of the bubble.\nUsing the differential equations to predict experimental markets as they evolved also proved successful, as the equations were approximately as accurate as human forecasters who had been selected as the best traders of previous experiments (Caginalp, Porter and Smith).\nThe challenge of using these ideas to forecast price dynamics in financial markets has been the focus of some of the recent work that has merged two different mathematical methods. The differential equations can be used in conjunction with statistical methods to provide short term forecasts.\nOne of the difficulties in understanding the dynamics of financial markets has been the presence of \u201cnoise\u201d (Fischer Black). Random world events are always making changes in valuations that are difficult to extract from any deterministic forces that may be present. Consequently, many statistical studies have only shown a negligible non-random component. For example, Poterba and Summers demonstrate a tiny trend effect in stock prices. White showed that using neural networks with 500 days of IBM stock was unsuccessful in terms of short term forecasts.\nIn both of these examples, the level of \u201cnoise\u201d or changes in valuation apparently exceeds any possible behavioral effects. A methodology that avoids this pitfall has been developed during the past decade. If one can subtract out the valuation as it varies in time, one can study the remaining behavioral effects, if any. An early study along these lines (Caginalp and Greg Consantine) studied the ratio of two clone closed-end funds. Since these funds had the same portfolio but traded independently, the ratio is independent of valuation. A statistical time series study showed that this ratio was highly non-random, and that the best predictor of tomorrow\u2019s price is not today\u2019s price (as suggested by EMH) but halfway between the price and the price trend.\nThe subject of overreactions has also been important in behavioral finance. In his 2006 PhD thesis, Duran examined 130,000 data points of daily prices for closed-end funds in terms of their deviation from the net asset value (NAV). Funds exhibiting a large deviation from NAV were likely to behave in the opposite direction of the subsequent day. Even more interesting was the statistical observation that a large deviation in the opposite direction preceded such large deviations. These precursors may suggest that an underlying cause of these large moves\u2014in the absence of significant change in valuation\u2014may be due to the positioning of traders in advance of anticipated news. For example, suppose many traders are anticipating positive news and buy the stock. If the positive news does not materialize they are inclined to sell in large numbers, thereby suppressing the price significantly below the previous levels. This interpretation is inconsistent with EMH but is consistent with asset flow differential equations (AFDE) that incorporate behavioral concepts with the finiteness of assets. Research continues on efforts to optimize the parameters of the asset flow equations in order to forecast near term prices (see Duran and Caginalp ).\nIt is important to classify the behavior of solutions for the dynamical system of nonlinear differential equations. Duran  studied the stability analysis of the solutions for the dynamical system of nonlinear AFDEs in R^4, in three versions, analytically and numerically. He found the existence of the infinitely many fixed points (equilibrium points) for the first two versions. He concluded that these versions of AFDEs are structurally unstable systems mathematically by using an extension of the Peixoto Theorem for two-dimensional manifolds to a four-dimensional manifold. Moreover, he obtained that there is no critical point (equilibrium point) if the chronic discount over the past finite time interval is nonzero for the third version of AFDEs.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Research in the news ==\nNY Times Article\nPittsburgh Tribune-Review Article\n\n\n== External links ==\nCaginalp's Papers via SSRN\nDuran's Papers via SSRN\nMadura's Papers via SSRN\nSmith's Papers via SSRN"}
{"title": "First Chicago Method", "text": "The First Chicago Method or Venture Capital Method is a business valuation approach used by venture capital and private equity investors that combines elements of both a multiples-based valuation and a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation approach. The First Chicago Method was first developed by, and consequently named for, the venture capital arm of the First Chicago bank, the predecessor of private equity firms Madison Dearborn Partners and GTCR.\n\nIt was first discussed academically in 1987.\n\n\n== Method ==\nThe First Chicago Method takes account of payouts to the holder of specific investments in a company through the holding period under various scenarios; see Corporate finance \u00a7 Quantifying uncertainty. \nMost often this methodology will involve the construction of:\n\nAn \"upside case\" or \"best-case scenario\" (often, the business plan submitted)\nA \"base case\"\nA \"downside\" or \"worst-case scenario.\"Once these have been constructed, the valuation proceeds as follows.\nFirst, for each of the three cases, a scenario specific, internally consistent forecast of cashflows - see  discussion under Financial modeling -  is constructed for the years leading up to the assumed divestment by the private equity investor.\nNext, a divestment price - i.e. a Terminal value - is modelled by assuming an exit multiple consistent with the scenario in question. (Of course, the divestment may take various forms - see Private equity #Investments in private equity.)\nThe cash flows and exit price are then discounted using the investor\u2019s required return, and the sum of these is the value of the business under the scenario in question.\nFinally, each of the three scenario-values are multiplied through by a probability corresponding to each scenario (as estimated by the investor). The value of the investment is then the probability weighted sum of the three scenarios.\n\n\n== Use ==\nThe method is used particularly in the valuation of growth companies which often do not have historical financial results that can be used for meaningful comparable company analysis.  Multiplying actual financial results against a comparable valuation multiple often yields a value for the company that is objectively too low given the prospects for the business.  \nOften the First Chicago Method may be preferable to a Discounted Cash Flow taken alone. This is because such income-based business value assessment may lack the support generally observable in the market place. Indeed, professionally performed business appraisals go further and use a set of methods under all three approaches to business valuation.Variations of the First Chicago Method are employed in a number of markets, including the private equity secondary market where investors project outcomes for portfolios of private equity investments under various scenarios.\n\n\n== See also ==\nrNPV: cash flows, as opposed to scenarios, are probability-weighted.\nExpected commercial value\nValuation using discounted cash flows #Determine equity value\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nAnn-Kristin Achleitner and  Eva Lutz.

{"title": "Master of Financial Economics", "text": "A master's degree in Financial Economics provides a rigorous understanding of theoretical finance and the economic framework upon which that theory is based. The degree is postgraduate, and usually incorporates a thesis or research component. Programs may be offered jointly by the business school and the economics department.\nThe nature of the degree differs by university. Generally, the degree is largely theoretical, and prepares graduates for research positions, for doctoral study in economics, or for roles in applied economics. Some are positioned as professional degrees, preparing graduates for careers in investment banking and finance,\nand are comparable to the Master of Science in Finance, though with an increased weighting towards economic theory. In some cases, programs are substantially quantitative and are largely akin to a Master of Quantitative Finance.\nClosely related degrees include the \"Master of Finance and Economics\"  and the \"Master of Economics with a specialization in Finance\". Recently, undergraduate degrees in the discipline are offered.The degree is gaining in recognition: Oxford's Financial Economics MSc  is first ranked worldwide amongst all Masters in Finance programs.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nMasters in Financial Economics are usually one to one and a half years in duration, and typically include a thesis or research component. \nThe programs require a bachelor's degree prior to admission, but do not (usually) require an undergraduate major in finance or economics; \na typical requirement is exposure to (multivariable) calculus and differential equations, statistics and probability theory, and linear algebra. \nMany programs include a review of these topics as an admission- or preliminary course.The curriculum is distributed between theory, applications, and modelling, with the emphasis on each differing by university and program, as above.\n\nThe theory component centres on decision making under uncertainty in the context of the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models. The degree essentially explores how rational investors would apply decision theory to the problem of investment.  Investment under \"certainty\" is initially considered (Fisher separation theorem, \"theory of investment value\", Modigliani-Miller theorem). \"Choice under uncertainty\" is then introduced, and the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency lead to modern portfolio theory and the CAPM, and to the Black\u2013Scholes theory for option pricing.  Where the program emphasizes economics, the curriculum is extended:  it explores phenomena where these assumptions do not hold (noise trading, market microstructure, behavioural finance) and it discusses models which are further generalised (arbitrage pricing theory, continuous time finance / Martingale pricing) or extended (Multi-factor models, models of the short rate, Intertemporal CAPM, Black\u2013Litterman model). Coursework here is often titled \"Asset pricing\" and \"Corporate finance theory\". Economics focused programs (often) separately cover microeconomics and /or decision theory as foundational topics.Application of the economic principles includes asset allocation and valuation, and covers specific financial instruments \u2014 such as fixed income, equities, derivatives, foreign exchange \u2014 and their portfolios. The aim here is twofold: firstly, to complement the theory; secondly, providing graduates with practical market knowledge. In the economics-focused degrees, this coverage may (will) be of secondary importance, while in the professional degrees it is a major component, and often includes separate course work in (practical) corporate finance, portfolio management and financial risk management. Macroeconomics is also usually included; often though, as opposed to covering macroeconomic theory in general, the topics are applied and / or finance related with a focus on modelling and forecasting the relationships between asset classes and their expected returns.The modelling curriculum complements both of the above.   The theory is augmented via the study of econometrics, financial time series and statistical modelling,  with a focus on the empirical and statistical testing of economic theory, and on developing and documenting new econometric models.  Students are taught to model using statistical packages such as SAS and EViews (and increasingly Python and R). The applications are reinforced through the computer based implementation of the more complex problems (often including numeric methods for option pricing, Value at risk, portfolio optimization and yield curve modeling). Here, though, the focus is typically on the concept as opposed to the modelling, per se, and may therefore be limited to the spreadsheet environment: Computational finance is the domain of specialized degrees, although some Financial Economics programs do emphasize mathematical modelling and programming.\n\n\n== Comparison with other qualifications ==\n\nThere is some overlap with programs in financial engineering, computational finance and mathematical finance; see Master of Quantitative Finance (MQF). These degrees aim to train practitioners and \"quants\" \u2014 i.e. specialists in derivatives, fixed income and risk analysis \u2014 as opposed to economists, and their curricula are therefore weighted toward stochastic calculus, numerical methods, simulation techniques and programming, and are quantitative (well) beyond the level of the Financial Economics degree. Entrance requirements are similarly more mathematical.  On the other hand, coverage of financial and economic theory, and econometrics, while significant, is comparatively secondary.  As mentioned, some Financial Economics programs are substantially quantitative; these differ little from the MQF.\nThe overlap with general finance degrees, such as a Master of Science in Finance (MSF) or an M.B.A. in finance, is further limited, particularly where the Financial Economics program is theory oriented. These degrees are focused on financial management, corporate finance and investment management, and are practice oriented with limited exposure to the underlying economic theory. However, since these courses train graduates in the use of the models developed in Financial Economics, the theory is (sometimes) covered in the context of a (basic) understanding of model assumptions. Similar comments apply to professional certifications such as the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation. The Master of Finance (M.Fin.) and M.Sc. Finance, as opposed to the MSF, have a significant theory component (as well as quantitative component), and largely overlap with the Masters in Financial Economics.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMaster of Finance\nMaster of Economics\nMaster of Quantitative Finance\nQEM\nCategory:Professional certification in finance\nOutline of finance \u00a7 Education\n\n\n== Notes ==\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Minority discount", "text": "Minority discount is an economic concept reflecting the notion that a partial ownership interest may be worth less than its proportional share of the total business. The concept applies to equities with voting power because the size of voting position provides additional benefits or drawbacks. For example, ownership of a 51% share in the business is usually worth more than 51% of its equity value\u2014this phenomenon is called the premium for control. Conversely, ownership of a 30% share in the business may be worth less than 30% of its equity value. This is so because this minority ownership limits the scope of control over critical aspects of the business. Share prices of public companies usually reflect the minority discount. This is why take-private transactions involve a substantial premium over recently quoted prices. \n\n\n== Properties of minority interest ==\nOn a per-share basis, buyers will pay less for minority interest versus a controlling or majority interest because a minority position strictly limits investors to make crucial business decisions. Below are some drawbacks penalizing minority shareholders.\n\nMinority owners do not manage the business.\nThey cannot initiate a sale or liquidation of the business.\nThey are limited to elect the company directors and to appoint its officers.\nThey do not hire or fire employees.\nThey do not declare and distribute dividends.\nThey do not enter into contractual relationships with customers and suppliers.\nThey do not raise debt or equity capital for the company.\nThey do not approve strategy plans, mergers and acquisitions, or capital expenditures.\n\n\n== Minority protection ==\nThe worse the minority shareholders' protection, the higher the minority discount. Nevertheless, minority owners may decrease the discount attached to their holdings. Some strategies to do so include inviting independent non-executive directors and shareholder activism. The activism can take several forms: proxy battles, publicity campaigns, shareholder resolutions, litigation, and negotiations with management.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links =="}

{"title": "Credit default option", "text": "In finance, a default option, credit default swaption or credit default option is an option to buy protection (payer option) or sell protection (receiver option) as a credit default swap on a specific reference credit with a specific maturity.  The option is usually European, exercisable only at one date in the future at a specific strike price defined as a coupon on the credit default swap.\nCredit default options on single credits are extinguished upon default without any cashflows, other than the upfront premium paid by the buyer of the option.  Therefore, buying a payer option is not a good protection against an actual default, only against a rise in the credit spread.  This may explain why such options are very illiquid. They may also feature quite high implied volatilities, as shown by Damiano Brigo (2005). However options on credit indices such as iTraxx and CDX include any defaulted entities in the intrinsic value of the option when exercised. This is expressed at times by stating that the options offer \"front-end protection\". Proper inclusion of front end protection complicates index options valuation, see for example Claus M.

{"title": "Debt-to-capital ratio", "text": "A company's debt-to-capital ratio or D/C ratio is the ratio of its total debt to its total capital, its debt and equity combined. The ratio measures a company's capital structure, financial solvency, and degree of leverage, at a particular point in time. The data to calculate the ratio are found on the balance sheet.\nPractitioners use different definitions of debt:\n\nAny interest-bearing liability to qualify.\nAll liabilities, including accounts payable and deferred income.\nLong-term debt and its associated currently due portion (measures capital structure).Companies alter their D/C ratio by issuing more shares, buying back shares, issuing additional debt, or retiring debt.\n\n\n== Definition and Details ==\nA measurement of a company's financial leverage, calculated as the company's debt divided by its total capital. Debt includes all short-term and long-term obligations. Total capital includes the company's debt and shareholders' equity, which includes common stock, preferred stock, minority interest and net debt.\nCalculated as:\nDebt-To-Capital Ratio = Debt / (Shareholder's Equity + Debt)\nCompanies can finance their operations through either debt or equity. The debt-to-capital ratio gives users an idea of a company's financial structure, or how it is financing its operations, along with some insight into its financial strength.\nBecause this is a non-GAAP measure, in practice, there are many variations of this ratio. Therefore, it is important to pay close attention when reading what is or isn't included in the ratio on a company's financial statements.\nNote: Above section is copied from Investopedia website.\n\n\n== Interpretation ==\nThe higher the debt-to-capital ratio, the more debt the company has compared to its equity. This tells investors whether a company is more prone to using debt financing or equity financing. A company with high debt-to-capital ratios, compared to a general or industry average, may show weak financial strength because the cost of these debts may weigh on the company and increase its default risk.\nSimilarly, a lower debt-to-capital ratio will indicate that significant portion of the company's capital is funded via Equity Capital. Generally, a company with lower debt-to-capital have greater flexibility in terms of raising additional capital via Debt. Hence, management tries to maintain a healthy capital structure that does not jeopardize the company Solvency.\n\n\n== See also ==\nDebt-to-equity ratio\nFinancial ratio\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Debt-to-capital ratio\".

{"title": "Real prices and ideal prices", "text": "The distinction between real prices and ideal prices is a distinction between actual prices paid for products, services, assets and labour (the net amount of money that actually changes hands), and computed prices which are not actually charged or paid in market trade, although they may facilitate trade. The difference is between actual prices paid, and information about possible, potential or likely prices, or \"average\" price levels. This distinction should not be confused with the difference between \"nominal prices\" (current-value) and \"real prices\" (adjusted for price inflation, and/or tax and/or ancillary charges). It is more similar to, though not identical with, the distinction between \"theoretical value\" and \"market price\" in financial economics.\n\n\n== Characteristics ==\nIdeal prices, expressed in money-units, can be \"estimated\", \"theorized\" or \"imputed\" for accounting, trading, marketing or calculation purposes, for example using the law of averages. Often the actual prices of real transactions are combined with assumed prices, for the purpose of a price calculation or estimate. Even if such prices therefore may not directly correspond to transactions involving actually traded products, assets or services, they can nevertheless provide \"price signals\" which influence economic behavior.\nFor example, if statisticians publish aggregated price estimates about the economy as a whole, market actors are likely to respond to this price information, even if it is far from exact, if it is based on a very large number of assumptions, and if it is later revised. The release of new GDP data, for instance, often has an immediate effect on stock market activity, insofar as it is interpreted as an indicator of whether and how fast the market \u2013 and consequently the incomes generated by it \u2013 is growing or declining.\nIdeal prices are typically prices that would apply in trade, if certain assumed conditions apply (and they may not). The number of ideal prices used for calculations or signalling in the world vastly exceeds the number of real prices fetched. At any point in time, most economic goods and services in society are being owned or used, but not traded; nevertheless people are constantly extrapolating prices which would apply if they were traded in markets or if they had to be replaced. Such price information is essential to estimate the possible incomes, budgetary implications or expenditures associated with a transaction.\nThe distinction is currently best known in the profession of auditing. It also has enormous significance for economic theory, and more specifically for econometric measurement and price theory; the main reason is that price data is very often the basis for making economic and policy decisions.\n\n\n== Differences between real and ideal prices ==\nA distinction between real (or actual) prices and ideal prices, was introduced in Marx's Grundrisse notebooks. In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy (1859), Marx already criticizes James Steuart and John Gray because they fudged the distinction between actual prices and ideal prices. In chapter 3 of the first volume of Das Kapital, Marx states:\n\nEvery trader knows, that he is far from having turned his goods into money, when he has expressed their value in a price or in imaginary money, and that it does not require the least bit of real gold, to estimate in that metal millions of pounds' worth of goods. When, therefore, money serves as a measure of value, it is employed only as imaginary or ideal money. This circumstance has given rise to the wildest theories. But, although the money that performs the functions of a measure of value is only ideal money, price depends entirely upon the actual substance that is money. (...) The possibility... of quantitative incongruity between price and magnitude of value, or the deviation of the former from the latter, is inherent in the price-form itself. This is no defect, but, on the contrary, admirably adapts the price-form to a mode of production whose inherent laws impose themselves only as the mean of apparently lawless irregularities that compensate one another. The price-form, however, is not only compatible with the possibility of a quantitative incongruity between magnitude of value and price, i.e., between the former and its expression in money, but it may also conceal a qualitative inconsistency, so much so, that, although money is nothing but the value-form of commodities, price ceases altogether to express value. \nThe activity of pricing goods, services and assets, facilitating transactions, communicating prices and keeping track of them in fact consumes a very large amount of human labour-time, irrespective of whether it happens to occur in a centralized or decentralized way. Millions of workers are professionally specialized in such activities, whether as clerks, tellers, buyers, retail assistants, accountants, financial advisors, bank workers, or economists etc. If that work is not done, price information would not be available, with the result that the trading process would become difficult or impossible to operate. Whether or not this is considered \"bureaucratic\", it therefore remains an essential administrative service. People cannot \"choose between prices\" if they don't even know what those prices are; and, normally, they cannot just \"make up\" any kind of price they like, because costing, budgets and incomes depend precisely on what price is charged.\nThe creation of price information is a production process \u2013 its output is worth money, because it is vital for the purpose of trade, and without it the circulation of goods and services could not occur. Price information can therefore be bought and sold as a commodity as well. But the production process of prices themselves is often hidden from view and hardly noticeable. Therefore, people often take the existence of price information for granted and as obvious, meriting no further inquiry. \"A mysterious certainty dominates our lives in late capitalist modernity: the price. Not a single day passes without learning, making, and taking it. Yet despite prices' widespread presence around us, we do not know much about them.\" A price may also be attached in the course of another activity, or the pricing procedure may be a closely guarded secret rather than accessible in an open market because if competitors knew about it, this could adversely affect business income. But if pricing processes are viewed as production processes, it turns out that much more is involved than the observation of a price-tag or number might suggest.\nFor most of the history of economics, economic theorists were not primarily concerned with explaining the actual, real price-levels. Instead their theorizing was concerned with theoretical (ideal) prices. Simon Clarke explains for example:\n\nThe marginalists were no more concerned with the determination of the actual prices that ruled on the market than were the classical economists. All the innovators emphasised the abstract character of pure economic theory, in which the intervention of chance and uncertainty, of specific historical institutions or political interventions, could all be ignored and their consideration deferred to subordinate empirical and policy studies. Pure theory was not concerned with the determination of actual prices but with their determination in an ideal world of perfect knowledge, perfect foresight, perfect competition and pure rationality. It is against this ideal world that the real world, and proposed reforms in the real world, are to be measured. The questions that gave rise to a demand for a pure theory of price were questions about the proper prices of commodities. Jevons, for example, was especially concerned with the problem of scarcity (in particular the scarcity of coal) and with the role of prices in allocating resources. The problem he posed was that of determining what prices would achieve the optimal allocation of resources. The solutions that were reached would then serve as the basis of policy prescriptions about the proper role of state intervention in the formation of prices in order to achieve such an allocation. \nIt is only relatively recently that economists have tried to create generalizations about the actual pricing procedures used by business enterprises, based on information about what business people actually do (instead of an abstract mathematical model).\n\n\n== Illustrations of ideal prices ==\nAn example would be an equilibrium price calculated by an economist. This is a price which a type of product or asset would theoretically have, if supply and demand were balanced. This price does not exist in actual trading processes except in special and rare cases; it is only an ideal or theoretical price level, which at best is only approximated in the real world.\nIn accounting practice, ideal prices are used all the time. For example, when accountants have to value a stock of assets, or a set of transactions across an interval of time (for tax, commercial or audit purposes), they apply rules and criteria to arrive at a price reflecting the cost or market-value of the stock or flow of transactions. In grossing and netting, they apply certain rules of inclusion and exclusion to obtain the desired measure. But the valuation obtained following a standard procedure is in truth only hypothetical, because it represents a price which the assets or flows would have if they were traded or exchanged under assumed (stylized or standardized) conditions, or if they were replaced at a certain point in time. In principle, they need not refer to any real transaction flows at all, being only an imputation. Yet, the ideal price obtained may nevertheless influence very many transactions based on it, to the extent that it provides information and a measure of how a related market process is thought to be evolving.\nIdeal prices are often used in price negotiations, bidding, price estimation and insurance. These are calculated prices for things being traded, or the compensation which would be given, if certain conditions apply. Business deals can become very complex, and may involve numerous price assumptions. For example, the contract may be that if an average price trend occurs, then a certain amount of money will be paid out. Thus, the actual amount of money that changes hands may be conditional on a variety of price estimates.\n\n\n== Actual and potential prices ==\nWhen goods are produced for sale, they may be priced, but those prices are initially only potential prices. There may not be any certainty about whether they will all fetch exactly the sum of money stated by those prices when they are actually sold, or whether they will be sold at all. In retrospect, the final value of an output, activity or asset may turn out to have been higher or lower than previously anticipated, because for various reasons prices and demand changed in the meantime. Thus, price negotiations, trading circumstances and the time factor may change actual prices realized from the prices originally set, and if price inflation occurs there is in addition a difference between the nominal prices and the inflation-adjusted price. The price of a stock or a debt security, expressed in a given currency, may be highly variable, and their variable yields may in turn revalue or devalue the prices of related assets.\nThus, the \"price mechanism\" is often not simply a function of supply and demand for a tradable object, but of a structure of related and co-existing prices, where fluctuations in one group of prices impact on another group of prices, perhaps quite contrary to the wishes of buyers and sellers. In this sense, the concept of a \"price shock\" refers to a drastic change in the price of a good which is widely used, and which therefore suddenly changes many related prices.\nThe sale price may be modified also by the difference in time between purchase and payment. For example, someone may opt to buy a product on credit, and pay interest in addition to the asking price for the product. The interest charge may vary during the interval in which the principal is paid off. Or, the price may change because of price inflation or because it is renegotiated. If it is not possible to pay for something within the previously expected time interval, that may also change prices.\nMike Beggs explains why credit instruments complicate the distinction between actual and ideal prices:\n\n...the essence of monetary relations is that exchange often is, and has been, mediated by credit relations rather than through the actual circulation of money. This is undeniably true: credit relationships transform exchange so that payments do not coincide with transactions and reciprocal relationships may mean that some debts balance without ever needing to be cleared by monetary payment.\nThe effect of credit instruments is, that actual payments are removed in space and time from the trade in debt obligations, and indeed the trade in debt can occur without necessarily involving any transactions with real money. In turn, this blurs the distinction between actual money (i.e. hard cash) and ideal money, or between real and ideal prices. In developed economies, cash in circulation normally ranges from 6% to 8% of GDP, but the debts of private banks alone are already a multiple of GDP (in the EU area, about 3.5x the total GDP).\n\n\n== Valuation criteria in pricing ==\nConsequently, what the \"real\" price of a thing is, might be a topic of dispute, because it may involve conditions and valuation criteria which some would not accept, because they apply different valuation criteria, different conditions or have a different purpose. For example, an asset or product may be valued by accountants and statisticians at:\n\nits historic cost\nits book value\nits accounting value\nits market value\nits nominal value\nits accrual value\nits promotional value\nits value for legal purposes\nits gross or net value\nits replacement value\nits trading value\nits FOB value\nits value before and after transport costs\nits transfer pricing value\nits value in terms of its future earnings potential\nits insurance value\nits pre-tax or post-tax value\nits depreciated value\nits inflation-adjusted value\nits value in a foreign currency\nits value at purchasing power parity\nits final (sold) valueA price can be computed for each of these valuations, depending on the purpose. Often the purpose is assumed to be self-evident, being related to a specific transaction, and so the price of something is taken as obvious.\n\n\n== Price abstraction ==\nThe price resulting from a calculation may be regarded as symbolizing (representing) one transaction, or many transactions at once, but the validity of this \"price abstraction\" all depends on whether the computational procedure and valuation method are accepted. The use of ideal prices for the purpose of accounting, estimation and theorising has become so habitual and ingrained in modern society, that they are frequently confused with the real prices actually realised in trade. Prices may be viewed only as a kind of data, information, or a type of knowledge, or the information available about a money quantity may be equated with the \"real thing\".\nThe concept of price is often used in a very loose sense to refer to all kinds of transactional possibilities. That can lead to theoretical errors. The notion of \"the price of something\" is often applied to sums of money denoting various quite different financial categories (e.g. a purchase or sale cost, the amount of a liability, the amount of a compensation, an asset value, an asset yield, an interest rate etc.).\nFor example, an interest rate can be defined as the \"price\" of borrowing money for a period of time. Here, the concept of price is used in the loose sense of \"a cost\" or \"a compensation.\" This loose sense means that the distinction between actual prices and ideal prices is lost. In turn, that means that the concept of price then stands for any kind of commercial valuation we care to make. Any activity, thing or transaction has its \"price-tag\", so to speak. It can be difficult to work out, even for an economist, what a price really means, and price information can be deceptive.\nIdeal prices are typically prices that would apply in trade, if certain assumed conditions apply (and they may not). Hence ideal prices are typically not observable, but instead inferences from observables. Transactions are registered in accounts, the accounting information is aggregated up to compute price data, and this data is in turn used to estimate price trends. In the process of so doing, there is a transition from observable price magnitudes to inferred price magnitudes. At best one could say, that the inferred price magnitudes are based on observable price magnitudes, but the link between them can be rather tenuous, since specific valuation assumptions may be introduced, so that the calculation procedure goes far beyond a simple arithmetical aggregation. Purely theoretical prices used for analytical purposes may have no correlate in the real world, or how exactly they relate to the real world may be unknown.\nThe knowledge of prices may have an effect influencing trading possibilities, which in turn changes the knowledge of prices. Consequently, such knowledge is often kept confidential or is a business secret (see also information security and sociological aspects of secrecy). A price system is therefore not necessarily transparent at all, quite apart from disputes over how a price is calculated, estimated or derived.\n\n\n== Are prices exact? ==\nMoney-prices are numbers, and numbers can be computed with exactitude. This seems to make accounting and economics exact sciences. But in the real world, prices can change quickly, due to innumerable conditions and it may be that prices can only be estimated for budgetary or contractual purposes. In aggregating them, a judgement is made about the meaning of the transactions involved, and boundaries are defined for where they begin and end.  Consequently, in calculating price quantities, valuation principles  of some sort is usually applied, regardless of whether this is made explicit or not. And, typically, this value theory refers to prices which would apply under certain assumed (theoretical) conditions, moving between real prices and ideal prices.\nIn an interview, the late Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot cited Louis Bachelier's thesis that prices have only one parameter defining their variability: they \"can only go up or down\" \u2013 and that, then, seems to provide a robust logical foundation for the mathematical modelling of price movements. But this sidesteps the qualitative problem that many different prices can be calculated for the same good, for all kinds of different purposes, using different valuation assumptions or transaction conditions. Bachelier's idea already assumes that we have a standard way to measure prices. Given that standard, one can then perform all kinds of mathematical operations on price distributions. Yet tradeable objects can also be combined and repackaged in numerous different ways, in which case the referent price may not simply go up or down, but instead refers to a different kind of deal. This issue is well known to official statisticians and economic historians, because they face the problem that the very objects whose price movements they aim to track change qualitatively across time, which may necessitate adjustments of the classification systems used to provide standard measures. A good example of that is the regimen of the consumer price index, which is periodically revised. But in times of rapid social change, the problem of devising a standard measure may be much more pervasive.\nThe mathematician John Allen Paulos stated that:  \n\nA well-known quotation, usually attributed to Einstein, is \"Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.\" I'd amend it to a less eloquent, more prosaic statement: unless we know how things are counted, we don't know if it's wise to count on the numbers. The problem isn't with statistical tests themselves but with what we do before and after we run them. First, we count if we can, but counting depends a great deal on previous assumptions about categorization. (...) Second, after we've gathered some numbers relating to a phenomenon, we must reasonably aggregate them into some sort of recommendation or ranking. This is not easy. By appropriate choices of criteria, measurement protocols and weights, almost any desired outcome can be reached. \nIt may of course be that not \"almost any desired outcome can be reached\" in price calculations, insofar as one would have to deny relevant evidence. Nevertheless, it may be that several different outcomes are possible, or that the presence of biases in interpreting price information can make a significant quantitative difference to the result. Insofar as economic actors have a vested self-interest in a particular quantitative result, because their income is at stake, then there is the possibility that they will prefer \"one sort of calculation\" to another, because it yields a financial result that favours their own position.\nThat financial result may be reasonably \"credible\" or \"plausible\" for the purpose of trading - if it was way out of kilter, trading partners would reject it - but it could involve a margin of distortion of the true situation. The small discrepancies would ordinarily not matter so much in individual transactions, but if a very large number of transactions is added up, the distortion might represent a substantial income for someone. For example, on 27 June 2012, Barclays Bank was fined $200m by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, $150m by the United States Department of Justice and \u00a359.5m by the Financial Services Authority for attempted manipulation of the Libor and Euribor rates (see Libor scandal).\n\n\n== FASB and the epistemology of prices ==\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board makes it very explicit that accounting measures for price information may not be completely exact or fully accurate, and that they may not be completely verifiable or absolutely authoritative. They may only be an approximation or estimate of a state of affairs. A price aggregate may be made up from a very large number of transactions and prices, which cannot all be individually checked, and the monetary value of which may involve a certain amount of interpretation. For example, a price may be set but we may not know for sure whether a good or asset actually traded at this price, or how far exactly the actual price paid diverged from the ordinary set price. However, the Board argues that, within certain acceptable limits of error, this is not a problem, so long as we bear in mind the practical purpose of the measures:\n\nIn summary, verifiability [in financial accounting] means no more than that several measurers are likely to obtain the same measure. It is primarily a means of attempting to cope with measurement problems stemming from the uncertainty that surrounds accounting measures and is more successful in coping with some measurement problems than others. Verification of accounting information does not guarantee that the information has a high degree of representational faithfulness, and a measure with a high degree of verifiability is not necessarily relevant to the decision for which it is intended to be useful.\n\n\n== The economic calculation problem and prices ==\nIn the classic socialist calculation debate, economic calculation was a problem for centrally planned economies. Necessarily the central planners had to engage in price accounting, and had to use price information, but the volume and complexity of transactions was so great, that genuine central planning of the economy was often not really feasible in practice; often the state authority could only enforce the conditions of access to resources with the aid of extensive policing. An additional problem was, that much of the price information was actually false or inaccurate, because economic actors had no interest in providing truthful information, because the nominal price of goods did not reflect their value, or because goods changed hands informally in ways which could not be formally recorded and known. The effect was that the computed accounting information was often a mixture of fact and fiction.\n\n\n== Pricing issues ==\nMarket economies often suffer from similar defects, in the sense that commercial price information is in practice deficient, false, distorted or inaccurate. This is not necessarily because trading parties intend to deceive - generally speaking, deception is bad for business reputations, at least in the long run - but simply because it is technically impossible to provide fully exact price information. Official price estimates can be inaccurate, rely on dubious valuation assumptions contrary to reality, or fail to be verified thoroughly, among other things because they rely on sample survey techniques or partial and infrequent information. Business price signals are not intrinsically always clear; they can be deceptive, understating or overstating the real situation, or present a completely false picture of transactions and values. Jean-Claude Trichet for example remarked in 2008 about the global financial crisis that:\n\nThe root cause of the crisis was a widespread undervaluation of risk. This included an underpricing of the unit of risk and an underassessment of the quantity of risk that financial operators took upon themselves.\nTrichet's suggestion is that completely wrong pricing occurred, with devastating results. A \"unit of risk\" does not really exist, but this category can nevertheless be thought of as the quantity of money which represents a \"possible\" financial loss. Risk-pricing is intrinsically a problem-fraught process, since it relies on assumptions about unknowns, in advance of actual events, and these unknowns may include factors that were not previously anticipated or included in the mathematical models.\n\n\n== Price discovery and information asymmetry ==\nCommenting on the information problems associated with prices, Randall S. Kroszner, a Governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, theorizes:\n\nWhen a product's track record is not well established, there should be a strong market demand for information in order to facilitate price discovery. Price discovery is the process by which buyers' and sellers' preferences, as well as any other available market information, result in the \"discovery\" of a price that will balance supply and demand, and provide signals to market participants about how most efficiently to allocate resources. This market-determined price will, of course, be subject to change as new information becomes available, as preferences evolve, as expectations are revised, and as costs of production change. In order for this process to work most effectively, market participants must utilize information relevant to value that product. Of course, searching out and using relevant sources of information \u2013 as well as determining what information is relevant  \u2013 has its own costs. To underscore the last point, with new [financial] instruments, it may not even be clear exactly what information is needed for price discovery \u2013 that is, some market participants may not know what they do not know and they may therefore terminate the information-gathering stage prematurely, unwittingly bearing the risks and costs of incomplete information. \nIn addition to the discrepancies between real prices and ideal prices, it may in fact be impossible at any one time to know what the \"correct\" price of something ought to be, even although it is being traded anyway, for an actual price. The \"correct\" price level is only an ideal price, namely a price at which supply and demand would tend towards balance. But because of inadequate information, that price may never be reached; supply and demand may only haphazardly adjust to each other using inadequate information. Just before the financial crisis of 2007\u201308, the Wall Street Journal reported that \"Today, 'way less than half' of all securities trade on exchanges with readily available price information, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Daniel Harris.  More and more securities are priced by dealers who don't publish quotes.  As a result, money managers can no longer gauge with certainty the value of some assets in mutual funds, hedge funds and other investment vehicles...\"  \nThe reassurance of a self-balancing market does not matter much when people are making money, but when they do not, they become very concerned with market imbalances (mismatch of supply and demand). \nWhen the information needed to calculate prices is inadequate for any reason, it becomes susceptible to swindles, confidence tricks and fraud which may be difficult to detect or combat, insofar as the trading parties have to make assumptions in interpreting price information where any \"misunderstanding\" is their own responsibility. The risks and risk-bearers may not be fully specifiable. In this context, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy states:\n\nWhen there is a risk, there must be something that is unknown or that has an unknown outcome. Therefore, knowledge about risk is knowledge about lack of knowledge. This combination of knowledge and lack thereof contributes to making issues of risk complicated from an epistemological point of view. \nThis problem is compounded if various extrapolated ideal prices used to guide economic actors rely on observed trends in real prices which fluctuate a great deal in ways that are difficult to predict, and if the predictions made themselves influence price levels. It plays an important role in the theory of information asymmetry to which Joseph Stiglitz has made important contributions.\nPrice information is likely to be reliable, \n\nif market actors have a self-interest in providing true information,\nif it is technically possible to obtain true and accurate information, and\nif there are comprehensive legal sanctions (penalties) for false price information.But additionally, any market cannot function unless participants show trust and cooperation, and are motivated to do so.\n\n\n== See also ==\nComparative statics\nEconomic calculation problem\nExchange value\nHeterodox economics\nPrice\nReal versus nominal value (economics)\nReproduction (economics)\nShadow Price\nValue-form\nValuation (finance)\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Keogh plan", "text": "Keogh plans are a type of retirement plan for self-employed people and small businesses in the United States.\n\n\n== History ==\nNamed for U.S. Representative Eugene James Keogh of New York, they are sometimes called HR10 plans. IRS Publication 560 refers to them as \"Qualified Plans\". They are different from individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\n\n\n== Format ==\nThere are two basic types of Keogh plan: defined-benefit, and defined-contribution.\nIn a defined-contribution plan, a fixed contribution (percentage of total paycheck or a fixed sum) is made per pay period. It may be set up as a profit-sharing plan, where the pension that one can withdraw after retirement depends on how much they invested in the plan while they worked.\nThe defined-benefits plan is more complex. It relies on an IRS formula to calculate the rate of contributions.\nIn either case, as in other retirement plans such as 401(k)s and IRAs, the funds in the plan can be invested in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc.\n\n\n== Benefits ==\nThe main benefit of a Keogh plan versus other retirement plans is that a Keogh plan has higher contribution limits for some individuals. For 2011, employees can generally contribute up to $16,500 per year, and the employer can contribute up to $32,500, for a total annual contribution of $49,000. The total contribution cap is $50,000 for 2012, $51,000 for 2013, $52,000 for 2014, and up to 25% of compensation or $53,000 in 2016, whichever is lower.A person with a Keogh plan can also contribute to an IRA (traditional or Roth).\n\n\n== Drawbacks ==\nKeogh plans are not as common as most other retirement plans because there are several limitations to Keogh plans.\nCompared to other retirement plans (traditional IRA, SIMPLE IRA, etc.), Keogh plans require more administrative paperwork. While most small business owners can manage to set up other plans themselves, a Keogh plan requires complex calculations and professional help to establish. They've been largely replaced by SEP IRAs, which have the same contribution limits but much less paperwork.Keogh plans cannot be established by an employee. Keogh plans are applicable to self-employed individuals who own their own unincorporated business (sole proprietorships, partnerships and LLCs).\nAll contributions must be made \"pre-tax\", meaning that the contributions can be deducted from this year's tax, but taxes must be paid on the money when it is withdrawn during retirement. There is no such thing as a \"Roth Keogh plan\".\nPenalties may apply for making withdrawals from a Keogh plan before the account holder turns 59\u00bd.\nThe main benefit of a Keogh plan versus other plans (Keogh's high contribution limit) is lost in individuals who do not make a high level of income. These individuals may get the same benefits of a Keogh plan with less administrative cost by using another type of retirement plan (401(k), SEP-IRA, etc.). This is best illustrated by comparing the following three scenarios:Scenario #1 \u2013 A self-employed accountant makes $50,000 per year from her accounting business. Her maximum contribution is 25% of her post-contribution income ($10,000, which would be the same as saying 20% of her gross income), regardless of whether she uses a SEP-IRA, Keogh plan, or SIMPLE 401(k). Since there are less administrative costs, she would benefit most from choosing either the SEP-IRA or SIMPLE 401(k).\nScenario #2 \u2013 A family physician who owns his own practice makes $100,000 per year. His maximum contribution is 25% of his post-contribution income ($20,000, which would be the same as saying 20% of his gross income) whether he uses a Keogh plan or a SEP-IRA. The cost of maintaining the SEP-IRA is much less, so he would benefit more from that plan.\nScenario #3 \u2013 An entrepreneur who owns a small marketing firm makes $400,000 per year. She wishes to contribute as much as possible to a retirement plan in order to minimize her current taxes. She could contribute up to $11,500 for a SIMPLE IRA, $49,000 to a SEP-IRA, or up to $50,000 (contribution cap for 2012) in a Keogh plan. By choosing the Keogh plan over the SEP-IRA, she can contribute an additional $1,000 per year into her retirement plan.\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Representative agent", "text": "Economists use the term representative agent to refer to the typical decision-maker of a certain type (for example, the typical consumer, or the typical firm).\nMore technically, an economic model is said to have a representative agent if all agents of the same type are identical. Also, economists sometimes say a model has a representative agent when agents differ, but act in such a way that the sum of their choices is mathematically equivalent to the decision of one individual or many identical individuals. This occurs, for example, when preferences are Gorman aggregable. A model that contains many different agents whose choices cannot be aggregated in this way is called a heterogeneous agent model.\nThe notion of the representative agent can be traced back to the late 19th century. Francis Edgeworth (1881) used the term \"representative particular\", while Alfred Marshall (1890) introduced a \"representative firm\" in his Principles of Economics. However, after Robert Lucas, Jr.'s critique of econometric policy evaluation spurred the development of microfoundations for macroeconomics, the notion of the representative agent became more prominent and more controversial. Many macroeconomic models today are characterized by an explicitly stated optimization problem of the representative agent, which may be either a consumer or a producer (or, frequently, both types of representative agents are present). The derived individual demand or supply curves are then used as the corresponding aggregate demand or supply curves. Since it has been shown that the commonly used demand functions do not aggregate to representative agents, the implications of representative agents models need not, and are unlikely to, hold for individual consumers.\n\n\n== Motivation ==\nWhen economists study a representative agent, this is because it is usually simpler to consider to one 'typical' decision maker instead of simultaneously analyzing many different decisions. Of course, economists must abandon the representative agent assumption when differences between individuals are central to the question at hand. For example, a macroeconomist might analyze the impact of a rise of oil prices on a typical 'representative' consumer; but some analyses of auctions involve heterogeneous agent models because competing potential buyers can value the good differently.\nHartley (1997) discusses the reasons for the prominence of representative agent modelling in contemporary macroeconomics. The Lucas critique (1976) pointed out that policy recommendations based on observed past macroeconomic relationships may neglect subsequent behavioral changes by economic agents, which, when added up, would change the macroeconomic relationships themselves. He argued that this problem would be avoided in models that explicitly described the decision-making situation of the individual agent. In such a model, an economist could analyze a policy change by recalculating the decision problem of each agent under the new policy, then aggregating these decisions to calculate the macroeconomic effects of the change.\nLucas' influential argument convinced many macroeconomists to build microfounded models of this kind. However, this was technically more difficult than earlier modelling strategies. Therefore, almost all the earliest general equilibrium macroeconomic models were simplified by assuming that consumers and/or firms could be described as a representative agent. General equilibrium models with many heterogeneous agents are much more complex, and are therefore still a relatively new field of economic research.\n\n\n== Critique ==\nHartley, however, finds these reasons for representative agent modelling unconvincing. Kirman (1992), too, is critical of the representative agent approach in economics. Because representative agent models simply ignore valid aggregation concerns, they sometimes commit the so-called fallacy of composition.  He provides an example in which the representative agent disagrees with all individuals in the economy. Policy recommendations to improve the welfare of the representative agent would be illegitimate in this case. Kirman concludes that the reduction of a group of heterogeneous agents to a representative agent is not just an analytical convenience, but it is \"both unjustified and leads to conclusions which are usually misleading and often wrong.\" In his view, the representative agent \"deserves a decent burial, as an approach to economic analysis that is not only primitive, but fundamentally erroneous.\"\nA possible alternative to the representative agent approach to economics could be agent-based simulation models which are capable of dealing with many heterogeneous agents. Another alternative is to construct dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models with heterogeneous agents, which is difficult, but is becoming more common (R\u00edos-Rull, 1995; Heathcote, Storesletten, and Violante 2009; Canova 2007 section 2.1.2).\n\nChang, Kim, and Schorfheide (2011) make a point similar to that of Kirman, in the context of a DSGE model where agents are heterogeneous because of uninsured labor income risk. They estimate a representative-agent DSGE model on the basis of the aggregate data implied by their heterogeneous-agent economy, and show that the estimated coefficients are inconsistent with the true parameters of the heterogeneous economy. They point out thatSince it is not always feasible to account for heterogeneity explicitly, it is important to recognize the possibility that the parameters of a highly-aggregated model may not be invariant with respect to policy changes.\nJackson and Yariv (2017) prove that representative agents for commonly used utility functions do not exist, and thereby typical macroeconomic models are not actually micro-founded.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAgent (economics)\nHomo economicus\nAggregate demand\nAggregation problem\nMethodological individualism\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nMauro Gallegati and Alan P.

{"title": "Alpha generation platform", "text": "An alpha generation platform is a technology used in algorithmic trading to develop quantitative financial models, or trading strategies, that generate consistent alpha, or absolute returns. The process of alpha generation refers to generating excess returns. Alpha generation platforms are tools used by hedge funds, banks, CTAs and other financial institutions to help develop and test quantitative trading strategies. Alpha generation platforms support quants in the creation of efficient and productive quantitative trading strategies.\n\n\n== Background ==\nTraditionally, quants have used tools such as MATLAB, R, C++ and other computer programming languages to create complex trading strategies that help them perform high-frequency trading. However, as market data volumes increase and more traders create financial models that deal with multi-asset class data, news sentiment data and more, quants must spend a large amount of time programming models, debugging code, and integrating multiple market data sources. This is why some firms have begun adding alpha generation platforms to their quant infrastructures.\nThese platforms are often seen as a complement to traditional quantitative tools as they can help quantitative analysts process huge volumes of market data. With many of these platforms, users can write out models in English, program models using the platform's supported computer languages, or import strategies written in MATLAB, C++, R and other languages. Alpha generation platforms also often include data integration and storage capabilities through built-in database solutions that capture, standardize and store massive volumes of financial tick data.\n\n\n== Methodology ==\nAlpha generation platforms are used to locate excess return in the capital market. They enable the development of mathematical and statistical models that help determine whether or not a specific investment may be profitable. In some quant-driven funds, these models make the final decision on whether to buy or sell an investment.These systems cannot be fully trusted and require qualified quantitative analysts to try to prevent massive drawdowns. The dangers of relying upon a platform were illustrated in a 2007 paper by Andrew Lo.The average quantitative strategy may take from 10 weeks to seven months to develop, code, test and launch. It is important to note that alpha generation platforms differ from low latency algorithmic trading systems. Alpha generation platforms focus solely on quantitative investment research rather than the rapid trading of investments.  While some of these platforms do allow analysts to take their strategies to market, others focus solely on the research and development of these highly complex mathematical and statistical models.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nCrypto Mining Information"}
{"title": "Mirror trading", "text": "Mirror trading is a trading selection methodology that can be carried out in both the foreign exchange and the stock markets; however, this is much more common in trading in the foreign exchange market.The mirror trading method allows traders in financial markets (and, to a lesser degree, stock markets) to select a trading strategy and to automatically \"mirror\" the trades executed by the selected strategies in the trader's brokerage account.There are two specifics of mirror trading. The first is connected with fundamentals of trading: to execute trades, investors copy signal services and auto-trading services. The second factor relates to the investment amounts, as mirror trading is linked to large investments.Traders can select strategies that match their personal trading preferences, such as risk tolerance and past profits. Once a strategy has been selected, all the signals sent by the strategy will be automatically applied to the client's brokerage account. The trades are delivered and executed automatically with entry and exit points on multiple currency pairs. No intervention is required by the client as all the account activity is controlled by the platform.Clients may trade one or more strategies concurrently. This enables the trader to diversify their risk while maintaining trading control of their account.\n\n\n== History ==\nSince its inception in the early 2000s, mirror trading has become widespread on financial markets. Mirror trading has influenced the development of copy trading and social trading.Mirror trading and copy trading were preceded by automated and algorithmic trading. There existed an automated trading system (ATS)  that allowed brokers to share their trading history with others. Mirror Trader was one of the first auto-trading systems that was introduced in 2005. It was developed by Tradency.With the development of financial instruments and digital tools, mirror trading gradually entered the portfolios of companies.\nSince 2007, ETX Capital has made publicly available on its platform a range of financial instruments, including mirror trading.The same year, IC Markets (International Capital Markets) began offering mirror trading, later growing to 200 countries globally with a trading record of USD 1.016 trillion per month in 2021.In 2010, eToro launched an electronic trading platform that started offering mirror trading operations in 130 countries, in 15 languages, to 25 million users globally, administering clients' assets totaling USD 10.6 billion.In 2012, FXCM (Forex Capital Markets) released an app-based trading platform with mirror trading. The same year, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) stated that mirror trading and copy trading constitute automated execution of trade signals and operate without client interaction.\n\n\n== Mirror trading vs Copy Trading ==\nMirror trading is sometimes also referred to as copy trading although copy trading differs slightly from mirror trading in the way that accounts are linked. In copy trading, the trader directly copies the moves of an individual successful trader; whereas in mirror trading, investment decisions are based on algorithms developed from trading patterns of number of successful traders. Forex brokers that offer mirror trading typically review, verify, and validate the trading results of strategies they add to their platform, which aids in identifying and eliminating losing trades. Before accepting a new strategy, a broker may require it to have a 12-month track record of profitability and a certain maximum drawdown limit.Traders might be system developers, individual investors, or financial organizations.\n\n\n== Differences from Copy Trading and Program Trading ==\nMirror Trading and Copy Trading are both examples of Social Trading, which utilizes social networks and websites such as Twitter, Youtube, and Facebook to enable users to communicate and trade investment-related information. Social trading is a relatively new method for obtaining investment ideas and trading advice, as compared to the traditional utilization of the opinions of professionals and experts. While engaging in social trading, there are always two alternatives users could choose from: Mirror Trading and Copy Trading.\n\n\n== Misperception regarding Fraud ==\nDue to the mirror-trading money laundering scheme performed by the Deutsche Bank\u2019s Moscow, New York and London branches in 2017, the term mirror trading began to be associated with fraudulent activities. In contrast, legitimate mirror trading is not fraudulent and is considered to be advantageous for novice investors. This outcome could be explained by the usage of algorithmic key elements in mirror trading. They replicate successful trades and patterns of experienced traders without depending on individual emotions. The process of mirror trading involves participants aligning their financial decisions with those of an established trader. This means that not everyone who engages in mirror trading is required to have expertise or experience with the assets they choose to trade.\nIn the decade preceding the Russian mirror-trading scheme, Deutsche Bank was informed of substantial and widespread compliance concerns. The offsetting trades in this instance lacked economic purpose and could have been used to facilitate money laundering or other illegal activity.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAlgorithmic trading\nSocial trading\nCopy trading\nList of asset management firms\nP2P asset management\nTrading strategy\nElectronic trading platform\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Uneconomic growth", "text": "Uneconomic growth is economic growth that reflects or creates a decline in the quality of life. The concept is used in human development theory, welfare theory, and ecological economics. It is usually attributed to ecological economist Herman Daly, though other theorists may also be credited for the incipient idea, According to Daly, \"uneconomic growth occurs when increases in production come at an expense in resources and well-being that is worth more than the items made.\" The cost, or decline in well-being, associated with extended economic growth is argued to arise as a result of \"the social and environmental sacrifices made necessary by that growing encroachment on the eco-system.\"\n\n\n== Types of growth ==\nThe rate or type of economic growth may have important consequences for the environment (the climate and natural capital of ecologies).  Concerns about possible negative effects of growth on the environment and society have led some to advocate lower levels of growth, from which comes the idea of uneconomic growth and Green parties which argue that economies are part of a global society and a global ecology and cannot outstrip their natural growth without damaging them.\nCanadian scientist David Suzuki argued in the 1990s that ecologies can only sustain typically about 1.5\u20133% new growth per year, and thus any requirement for greater returns from agriculture or forestry will necessarily cannibalize the natural capital of soil or forest. Some think this argument can be applied even to more developed economies.\n\n\n== The role of technology, and Jevons paradox ==\nMainstream economists would argue that economies are driven by new technology\u2014for instance, we have faster computers today than a year ago, but not necessarily physically more computers. Growth that relies entirely on exploiting increased knowledge rather than exploiting increased resource consumption may thus not qualify as uneconomic growth. In some cases, this may be true where technology enables lower amounts of input to be used in producing the same unit of product (and/or it reduces the amount or hazardousness of the waste generated per unit product produced) (e.g., the increased availability of movies through the Internet or cable television electronically may reduce the demand for physical video tapes or DVDs for films). Nonetheless, it is crucial to also recognise that innovation- or knowledge-driven growth still may not entirely resolve the problem of scale, or increasing resource consumption. For instance, there might likely be more computers due to greater demand and replacements for slower computers.\nThe Jevons Paradox is the proposition that technological progress that increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, tends to increase (rather than decrease) the rate of consumption of that resource. For example, given that expenditure on necessities and taxes remain the same, (i) the availability of energy-saving lightbulbs may mean lower electricity usage and fees for a household but this frees up more discretionary, disposable income for additional consumption elsewhere (an example of the \"rebound effect\") and (ii) technology (or globalisation) that leads to the availability of cheaper goods for consumers also frees up discretionary income for increased consumptive spending.\nOn the other hand, new renewable energy and climate change mitigation technology (such as artificial photosynthesis) has been argued to promote a prolonged era of human stewardship over ecosystems known as the Sustainocene. In the Sustainocene, \"instead of the cargo-cult ideology of perpetual economic growth through corporate pillage of nature, globalised artificial photosynthesis will facilitate a steady state economy and further technological revolutions such as domestic nano-factories and e-democratic input to local communal and global governance structures. In such a world, humans will no longer feel economically threatened, but rather proud, that their moral growth has allowed them to uphold Rights of Nature.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBaker, Linda (May\u2013June 1999). \"Real Wealth: The Genuine Progress Indicator Could Provide an Environmental Measure of the Planet's Health\".

Upside risk is calculated using data only from days when the benchmark (for example S&P 500 Index) has gone up. Upside risk focuses on uncertain positive returns rather than negative returns. For this reason,  upside risk, while a measure of unpredictability of the extent of gains, is not a \u201crisk\u201d in the sense of a possibility of adverse outcomes.\n\n\n== Upside risk vs. Capital Asset Pricing Model ==\nLooking at upside risk and downside risk separately provides much more useful information to investors than does only looking at the single Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) beta.

{"title": "Sector rotation", "text": "Sector rotation is a theory of stock market trading patterns.In this context, a sector is understood to mean a group of stocks representing companies in similar lines of business.\nThe basic premise is that these stocks can be expected to perform similarly. Additionally, different groups of stocks which have been clustered according to the aforementioned principle will show differing performance.\nSector rotation theory says a number of things. First, whichever sector is hot (has done well recently) should continue to outperform. Second, these sectors will eventually rotate so that whatever was once out of favor will be in favor. Third, these movements are somewhat predictable, and connected with the business cycle.\nWith the phase-shift in the performance cycle of sectors (ideally like the phase-shifted wave patterns of three-phase electric power) an investor could continually hop from a sector at the peak of performance to a sector showing a potential to rise.\nA sector rotation investment strategy is not a passive investment strategy like indexing, and requires periodic review and adjustment of sector holdings. Tactical asset allocation and sector rotation strategies require patience and discipline, but have the potential to outperform passive indexing investment strategies.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nAn investor or trader may describe the current market movements as favoring basic material stocks over semiconductor stocks by calling the environment a sector rotation from semiconductors to basic materials.\nAn example of a sector clustering would be:\nLeading\nThis includes stocks like consumer cyclicals and financial companies. These would do well when the market is at its bottom.\nIn-line\nThis includes stocks like technology and telecommunication. These should outperform the overall market in the main part of a bull market.\nLagging\nThis includes stocks like energy companies. These would perform well when the market is at its top.\nContrarian\nThis includes consumer staples. These should perform least badly in a bear market.Note that the performances mentioned are always relative to the overall market. During a bear market it is expected that all stocks will go down some.\n\n\n== Connection with other markets ==\nThe primary driver of sector rotation is the variability of currency values (inflationary, disinflationary, or deflationary) and interest rates.  As the economy expands, demand for raw materials creates inflationary pressures, which in turn prompt higher interest rates, which increase the value of the currency, which reduces the competitiveness of a country's exports as the currency causes them to cost more to other countries.  This final stage causes the economy to contract, reducing demand for raw materials, which creates deflationary pressures, which in turn prompt lower interest rates, which decrease the value of the currency, which increases the competitiveness of a country's exports\u2014creating a new market cycle.  The relative strength of commodities, bonds, currencies, and stocks shift in this changing monetary climate in a somewhat predictable manner.\n\n\n== Saying ==\n\"The worst house in a good neighborhood is better than the best house in a bad neighborhood.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nStyle investing\n\n\n== References ==\nMurphy, John.

{"title": "Style investing", "text": "Style investing is an investment approach in which securities are grouped into categories, and portfolio allocation is based on selection among \"styles\" rather than among individual securities. \nStyle investors, then, make portfolio allocation decisions by placing their money in broad categorizations of assets, such as small-cap, value, low-volatility, or emerging markets.  \nSome investors dynamically allocate across different styles and move funds back and forth between these styles depending on their expected performance.Styles enable institutional investors to organize and simplify their portfolio allocation decisions, as well as to measure and evaluate the performance of professional managers relative to standardized style benchmarks  (see style drift).\nAn implication of style investing is that it could impact financial markets, causing stocks to move together.\n\n\n== Asset pricing ==\nStyle investing can be used in the study of asset prices and can serve as a useful framework for identifying anomalous price movements in stocks, and to then study the relation between risk and return in asset pricing models.  See Returns-based style analysis. \nAs above, style investing generates co-movement between individual assets and their styles.  \nMomentum and reversal patterns exist both at style level and security level and style investing plays an important role in the predictability of returns.Barberis and Shleifer present a model where investors allocate funds based on the relative performance of investment styles which explains style momentum: \"if an asset performed well last period, there is a good chance that the outperformance was due to the asset\u2019s being a member of a \u201chot\u201d style...If so, the style is likely to keep attracting inflows from switchers next period, making it likely that the asset itself also does well next period\u201d.Style investing can also lead to mispricing: when a security is re-classified, such as when a stock is added to the S&P 500 index, its co-movement with the index increases while its co-movement with stocks outside of the index declines and possibly hurting performance.\n\n\n== Classification ==\nWhen classifying securities into styles, investors group together assets that appear to be similar, in the sense that they have a common characteristic. (Styles may then overlap asset classes.) A characteristic can be an obvious one such as the country in which the security is traded, or the industry in which the firm operates. Other characteristics used as the basis for a style are based on size, risk, valuation, price return, or profitability. \nValue investing is  well-known and emerged as a distinctive equity style following the work of Graham and Dodd (1934).Stocks can be split into categories such as small-cap, mid-cap, large-cap, value, defensive, cyclical, growth, international, regional, technology stocks, utility stocks, old economy or new economy, disruptive innovation, and so on. Classification of securities into categories is widespread in financial markets applying to other asset classes also. \nBonds are split into high-yield bonds and investment grade bonds and short-duration and long-duration bonds. Traders classify assets as liquid securities such as private equity and public equity. They may also do the same with illiquid securities, such as private debt, illiquid hedge funds, direct real estate and venture capital.\n\n\n== Financial industry ==\nFinancial firms Lipper and Morningstar developed and refined categorization systems and Style Box tools to aid with classification in the 1970s and 1990s. Also major index providers such as MSCI and FTSE offer a wide range of style-based indices. Also many asset managers offer style-based active strategies, sometimes also referred to as factor investing.\n\n\n== See also ==\nStyle drift\nReturns-based style analysis\nLow-volatility investing\nSector rotation\nSize premium\nValue investing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nStyle Investing: Yale\nStyle Investing: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows\nStyle Investing: Merrill Lynch\nStyle Investing: Harvard\nStyle Investing, Comovement and Return Predictability"}
{"title": "Liability-driven investment strategy", "text": "Liability-driven investment policies and asset management decisions are those largely determined by the sum of current and future liabilities attached to the investor, be it a household or an institution. As it purports to associate constantly both sides of the balance sheet in the investment process, it has been called a \"holistic\" investment methodology.\nIn essence, the liability-driven investment strategy (LDI) is an investment strategy of a company or individual based on the cash flows needed to fund future liabilities. It is sometimes referred to as a \"dedicated portfolio\" strategy. It differs from a \u201cbenchmark-driven\u201d strategy, which is based on achieving better returns than an external index such as the S&P 500 or a combination of indices that invest in the same types of asset classes. LDI is designed for situations where future liabilities can be predicted with some degree of accuracy. For individuals, the classic example would be the stream of withdrawals from a retirement portfolio that a retiree will make to pay living expenses from the date of retirement to the date of death. For companies, the classic example would be a pension fund that must make future payouts to pensioners over their expected lifetimes (see below).\n\n\n== LDI for individuals ==\nA retiree following an LDI strategy begins by estimating the income needed each year in the future. Social security payments and any other income is subtracted from the income needed to determine how much will have to be withdrawn each year from the money in the retirement portfolio to meet the income need. These withdrawals become the liabilities that the investment strategy targets. The portfolio must be invested so as to provide the cash flows that match the withdrawals each year, after factoring in adjustments for inflation, irregular spending (such as an ocean cruise every other year), and so on. Individual bonds provide the ability to match the cash flows needed, which is why the term \"cash flow matching\" is sometimes used to describe this strategy. Because the bonds are dedicated to providing the cash flows, the term \"dedicated portfolio\" or \u201casset dedication\u201d is sometimes used to describe the strategy.\n\n\n== LDI for pension funds ==\nA pension fund following an LDI strategy focuses on the pension-fund assets in the context of the promises made to employees and pensioners (liabilities). This is in contrast to an approach which focuses purely on the asset side of the pension fund balance sheet. There is no single accepted definition or approach to LDI and different managers apply different approaches. Typical LDI strategies involve hedging, in whole or in part, the fund's exposure to changes in interest rates and inflation. These risks can eat into a pension scheme's ability to keep their promises to members. Historically, bonds were used as a partial hedge for these interest rate risks but the recent growth in LDI has focused on using swaps and other derivatives. Various approaches will pursue a \"glide path\", which, over time, seeks to reduce interest rate and other risks while achieving a return that matches or exceeds the growth in projected pension plan liabilities.  These various approaches offer significant additional flexibility and capital efficiency compared to bonds, but also raise issues of added complexity, especially when the rebalancing of an LDI portfolio following changes in interest rates is considered.LDI investment strategies have come to prominence in the UK as a result of changes in the regulatory and accounting framework. IAS 19 (one of the International Financial Reporting Standards) requires that UK companies post the funding position of a pension fund on the corporate sponsor's balance sheet. In the US the introduction of FAS 158 (Financial Accounting Standards Board) has created a similar requirement.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBenchmark-driven investment strategy\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nMichael Ashton, \"Maximizing Personal Surplus: Liability-Driven Investment for Individuals\", October 28, 2010.

{"title": "Fairness opinion", "text": "A fairness opinion is a professional evaluation by an investment bank or other third party as to whether the terms of a merger, acquisition, buyback, spin-off, or privatization are fair.  It is rendered for a fee.  They are typically issued when a public company is being sold, merged or divested of all or a substantial division of their business. They can also be required in private transactions not involving a company that is traded on a public exchange, as well as in circumstances other than mergers, such as a corporation exchanging debt for equity. Some of the specific functions of a fairness opinion are to aid in decision-making, mitigate risk, and enhance communication.\n\n\n== Controversy ==\nControversy in financial and management circles surrounds the question of the objectivity of fairness opinions, as one aspect of the duty of care in the fairness of a transaction.  A potential exists for a conflict of interest when an entity rendering an opinion may benefit from the transaction either directly or indirectly.   Directors  and officers of the companies also may have an interest in the outcome of the proposed transaction.  In response, in the United States, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (then the National Association of Securities Dealers) issued its Rule 2290 to require disclosure by its members to minimize abuses; this was approved in 2007 by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\n\n== Equity and fairness ==\nIn the United States, in the context of stockholder lawsuits,  typically relating to the sale or merger of a public company, the Delaware Court of Chancery has required sufficient disclosures be made to a board of directors and shareholders to \u201cprovide a balanced, truthful account of all matters\u201d and said \u201cWhen a document ventures into certain subjects, it must do so in a manner that is materially complete and unbiased by the omission of material facts.\u201d  In a Memorandum Opinion in the CheckFree/Fiserv merger Chancellor Chandler underlined that the earlier In re Pure Resources Court had established the proper frame of analysis for disclosure of financial data: \u201c[S]tockholders are entitled to a fair summary of the substantive work performed by the investment bankers upon whose advice the recommendations of their board as to how to vote on a merger or tender rely.\u201d  According to the certification hypothesis fairness opinions may also serve the interest of the shareholders by mitigating informational asymmetries in corporate transactions.\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Discounted payback period", "text": "The discounted payback period (DPB) is the amount of time that it takes (in years) for the initial cost of a project to equal to discounted value of expected cash flows, or the time it takes to break even from an investment. It is the period in which the cumulative net present value of a project equals zero.\n\n\n== Calculation ==\nCumulative discounted cash flows will start with a negative value due to the original cost of investment, but as cash is generated each year after the original investment the discounted cash flows for those years will be positive, and the cumulative discounted cash flows will progress in a positive direction towards zero. When the negative cumulative discounted cash flows become positive, or recover, DPB occurs.  \nDiscounted payback period is calculated by the formula:   \n\nDPB = Year before DPB occurs + Cumulative Discounted Cash flow in year before recovery \u00f7 Discounted cash flow in year after recovery\n\n\n== Advantages ==\nDiscounted payback period helps businesses reject or accept projects by helping determine their profitability while taking into account the time-value of money. This is done via the decision rule: If the DPB is less than its useful life, or any predetermined period, the project can be accepted. If the DPB is greater than the specified period or the project's useful life, the project should be rejected. The DPB also helps compare mutually exclusive projects, as the project with the shorter DPB should be accepted.\n\n\n== Disadvantages ==\nThe discounted payback method still does not offer concrete decision criteria to determine if an investment increases a firm's value. In order to calculate DPB, an estimate of the cost of capital is required. Another disadvantage is that cash flows beyond the discounted payback period are ignored entirely with this method.\n\n\n== See also ==\nPayback period\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Program trading", "text": "Program trading is a type of trading in securities, usually consisting of baskets of fifteen stocks or more that are executed by a computer program simultaneously based on predetermined conditions. Program trading is often used by hedge funds and other institutional investors pursuing index arbitrage or other arbitrage strategies. There are essentially two reasons to use program trading, either because of the desire to trade many stocks simultaneously (for example, when a mutual fund receives an influx of money it will use that money to increase its holdings in the multiple stocks which the fund is based on), or alternatively to arbitrage temporary price discrepancies between related financial instruments, such as between an index and its constituent parts.According to the New York Stock Exchange, in 2006 program trading accounts for about 30% and as high as 46.4% of the trading volume on that exchange every day. Barrons breaks down its weekly figures for program trading between index arbitrage and other types of program trading. As of July 2012, program trading made up about 25% of the volume on the NYSE; index arbitrage made up less than 1%.\n\n\n== History ==\nSeveral factors help to explain the explosion in program trading. Technological advances spawned the growth of electronic communication networks. These electronic exchanges, like Instinet and Archipelago Exchange, allow thousands of buy and sell orders to be matched very rapidly, without human intervention.\nIn addition, the proliferation of hedge funds with all their sophisticated trading strategies have helped drive program-trading volume.As technology advanced and access to electronic exchanges became easier and faster, program trading developed into the much broader algorithmic trading and high-frequency trading strategies employed by the investment banks and hedge funds.\n\n\n== Program trading firms ==\nProgram Trading is a strategy normally used by large institutional traders. Barrons shows a detailed breakdown of the NYSE-published program trading figures each week, giving the figures for the largest program trading firms (such as investment banks).\n\n\n== Index arbitrage ==\nIndex Arbitrage is a particular type of Program Trading which attempts to profit from price discrepancies between the basket of stocks which make up a stock index and its derivatives (such as the future based on that index). As of July 2012, it makes up less than 5% of the active Program Trading volume on the NYSE daily.\n\n\n=== Premium buy and sell execution levels ===\nThe \"premium\" (PREM) or \"spread\" is the difference between the stock index future fair value and the actual index level. As the derivative is based on the index, the two should normally have a very close relationship. If there is a sufficiently large difference the arbitraging program will attempt to buy the relatively cheap level (whether that is the basket of stocks which make up the index or the index future) and sell the relatively expensive product, making money from the price discrepancy. The fair value calculation takes into account the time to expiration of the future contract, the dividends received from holding all the stocks, and the interest cost of buying the stocks.\n\n\n== Regulations ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, program trading has been subject to regulation and oversight in response to concerns about its impact on market stability and volatility. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) introduced rules known as trading curbs or circuit breakers to address extreme volatility caused by program trading during the 1980s and 90s. Depending on the severity of price movements, these rules can lead to the halt of all program trading or restrict the trading of sell portfolios to upticks only.In addition to NYSE rules, regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have established rules governing algorithmic trading strategies, including high-frequency trading (HFT). FINRA Rule 3110 (Supervision) outlines the regulatory requirements for member firms engaged in algorithmic strategies.\n\n\n=== China ===\nThe China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has introduced a monitoring and reporting mechanism for program trading in Chinese stock markets in 2023. Stock exchanges in Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Beijing will implement rules on program trading and establish reporting systems to monitor unusual activities. These measures are set to take effect on October 9, 2023. The move comes in response to concerns about the role of computer-generated algorithms in stock trading, which have been blamed for exacerbating sell-offs in China's struggling stock markets.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAutomated trading system\nAlgorithmic trading\nHigh-frequency trading\nAlternative trading system\nElectronic trading platform\nDark pool\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board", "text": "The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) is a United States self-regulatory financial organization that writes investor protection rules and other rules regulating broker-dealers and banks in the municipal securities market.  This including tax-exempt and taxable municipal bonds, municipal notes, and other securities issued by states, cities, and counties or their agencies to help finance public projects or for other public policy purposes.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe MSRB was created by the Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended by the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, Pub. L.Tooltip Public Law (United States) 94\u201329, and codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o-4(b)) to create a mechanism for the regulation of municipal securities as well as brokers, dealers, and banks in the municipal securities business.The Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 broadened the MSRB's rulemaking authority to also regulate so-called municipal advisors, which include financial advisors, swap advisors, brokers of guaranteed investment contracts and other market participants that advise on the issuance of municipal securities and provide certain other types of advice to state and local governments, public pension funds and other municipal entities on municipal derivatives, investment strategies and other financial matters. As of March 2013, since the SEC has not released the definition of \"municipal advisor\", the MSRB's rules in this regard are suspended and there is considerable concern in the industry as to whether underwriters and/or other regulated professionals may be viewed as municipal advisors, thereby having the related fiduciary duties. The MSRB's investor protection rules will be extended to protect municipal entities as well.\n\n\n== Mandate ==\nLike the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the MSRB is a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The MSRB is authorized to create rules designed \"to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.\" While the MSRB sets standards for broker-dealers, banks, and municipal advisors, MSRB rules do not apply to issuers of municipal securities or other municipal entities, which Congress generally exempted from most provisions of the federal securities laws (such as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940) otherwise applicable to private-sector issuers of corporate and other types of securities. MSRB rules are enforced by various other federal regulatory organizations, including the SEC, FINRA, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).Among its investor protection rules, the MSRB is best known for adopting the first nationwide Pay to Play rule, known as Rule G-37, designed to eliminate the use of political contributions to obtain municipal underwriting business from state and local governments.  The MSRB's investor protection rules also apply to state-operated 529 plans marketed by broker-dealers, as well as to the underwriting, sales and trading of Build America Bonds and other taxable municipal obligations. In addition, the MSRB operates the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system, which provides free on-line access to comprehensive municipal securities disclosure documents, trade prices, interest rate information, and market statistics.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe MSRB is composed of members from regulated broker-dealers and banks as well as from the public.

{"title": "Chartered Insurance Institute", "text": "The Chartered Insurance Institute (also known as the CII) is a professional body dedicated to building public trust in the insurance and financial planning profession. The CII's purpose, as set out in its 1912 royal charter, is to 'Secure and justify the confidence of the public' in its members and the insurance sector as a whole. It aims to do this by setting standards of integrity, technical competence, and business capability.\nIn February 2016 Sian Fisher joined the Chartered Insurance Institute as CEO, taking over after Sandy Scott's 16-year tenure. In November 2016, she launched a Strategic Manifesto outlining a 5-year plan to ensure the CII remains a valued partner and that the body's purpose and vision are relevant to the challenges facing the profession.\n\n\n== Origins ==\nThe first Insurance Institute was established in Manchester on 14 March 1873 to provide an environment for the social exchange of knowledge and ideas on the subject of insurance, with a particular focus on fire insurance, given the number of textile manufacturers in the city. The Insurance Institute of Manchester had a selective membership policy and required members to hold senior positions within the industry, which led to the creation of a Junior Insurance Institute (later Insurance Association of Manchester) in 1883 to provide education to those new to insurance.[1]\nThe second local institute to be formed was the Insurance and Actuarial Society of Glasgow founded in 1881, which held education as its main focus.[2] Following that the institutes of Ireland (in Dublin, 1885), Norwich (1886), Birmingham (1887), Yorkshire (in Leeds, 1888), Bristol (1890), Newcastle upon Tyne (1896), and Nottingham (1896), were formed, though with varying names, e.g. Insurance Social and Musical Society of Bristol.[3]\nThere was a growing interest in the idea of a central institute which would bolster the work and profile of the existing institutes, and so in March 1897 a conference of representatives from the 10 institutes was held in Manchester, and it was decided that they should form an association called The Federation of Insurance Institutes of Great Britain and Ireland. At this conference, it was also proposed that an annual journal of insurance papers should be produced, that the institutes should jointly offer examinations and certificates, and that an insurance clerks\u2019 orphanage should be established.[4]\nInitially, the responsibility for the Journal was assumed by the Birmingham and Glasgow institutes, while the Yorkshire institute and the Manchester association prepared the educational program, proposing that the Federation should act only as an examining body while local institutes undertook the teaching.[5] The Insurance Clerks\u2019 Orphanage was established as an independent organization in 1902, operating out of the offices of the London Salvage Corps.[6]\nAt the 1906 conference of the Federation, it was decided that a royal charter should be sought and that the London Institute should act as a headquarters. In 1908, as a step towards gaining the charter, a constitution was agreed between the institutes, and the name was changed to The Insurance Institute of Great Britain and Ireland. The royal charter was granted in 1912 and the Insurance Institute of Great Britain and Ireland became the Chartered Insurance Institute.[1] At this time there were 21 local institutes in Great Britain and Ireland and 4 affiliated institutes from within the British Empire.[2]\n\n\n== Charter ==\nThe royal charter incorporating the Chartered Insurance Institute was granted on 17 January 1912 by King George V. Each royal charter that is granted is unique in format and content as it is drawn up and contains the bye-laws deemed relevant by the body to be incorporated.[3] A new supplemental charter, replacing all former versions of the charter, was granted by Queen Elizabeth II on 27 January 1987.\nArticle 3 of the CII's current charter identifies the six \"objects and purposes for which the Institute is constituted\":\n\n(a) To promote efficiency and improvement in the practice of insurance among persons engaged or employed in that activity, whether Members of the Institute or not, to render the conduct of such business more effective and professional, to secure and justify the confidence of the public and employers by the conduct of reliable tests of the competence of persons engaged or employed in insurance and the provisions of reliable assurances of their trustworthiness and to provide and maintain a central organization for those purposes;\n(b) To promote and assist the study of any subjects bearing on any branch of insurance;\n(c) To collect and form a body of expert opinion on the law and practice relating to all things connected with insurance;\n(d) To exercise supervision and control over the professional standards and conduct of the Members. To seek to improve the professional status of Fellows and Associates and to promote the interests, welfare, and advancement of the Members in general;\n(e) To provide information and advice about employment in insurance for Members and others;\n(f) To assist Members and the dependants of Members or of deceased Members suffering financial hardship by such measures as may be deemed appropriate and to contribute directly or indirectly to the work of the Insurance Charities and any other appropriate fund or charity.[4]\n\n\n=== Chartered titles ===\nAs a chartered body, the Chartered Insurance Institute has the right to grant specific chartered titles. CII members must first request the grant for a new title at a general meeting of the membership. This is followed by a petition to the Privy Council. If the Privy Council deem the petition agreeable, a minister signs an order allowing the CII to incorporate the right to grant and award the new title. The change is then duly inserted into the institute's bye-laws.\nThe CII has five chartered titles which may be conferred upon individuals in the profession depending upon their specialization:\n\nChartered Insurance Broker\nChartered Insurer\nChartered Insurance Practitioner\nChartered Insurance Risk Manager\nChartered Financial PlannerIn addition, there are three Chartered titles to cover different specializations for organizations in the insurance and financial advice profession:\n\nChartered Insurance Brokers\nChartered Insurers\nChartered Financial Planners\n\n\n== The Insurance Hall ==\nThe Insurance Hall, located at 20 Aldermanbury in the City of London, was proposed by Sir Frederick William Pascoe Rutter (the 1910-11 president) in a speech delivered in 1919 entitled The CII: Its right to work, in which he proposed that the CII should have its building in London to act as a designated meeting place for members and to house a library to facilitate study.[1] The purchase of the freehold on the land and the construction of the building was funded through donations amassed between 1919 and 1932, and debentures issued to insurance companies.[2] The Insurance Hall was opened by King George V on 28 June 1934.[3]\nThe Insurance Hall is a Grade-II listed building in a Tudorbethan style with stained glass windows bearing the names and emblems of insurance companies that subscribed to the CII and finished internally with wood paneling.[4] The building initially contained a 480-seat conference hall, a council chamber, a library, a museum, a common-room and writing room for members, 4 classrooms and offices occupied by the CII staff, the Insurance Institute of London, the Life Office's Association, the Insurance Charities, and the Insurance Official's Society.[3]\nThe Insurance Hall was one of few buildings in the area left standing after the bombardment of 29th-30th December 1940, in part due to the efforts of the house steward, Gordon Edward Stewart, who remained in the building to put out fires during the raid. Following the raid, the CII hosted the events of the Chartered Institute of Secretaries and the Institute of Actuaries as their halls had been destroyed.[5]\nIn 1964 the adjoining land at 21 Aldermanbury was developed into a 5-story extension to the Insurance Hall to provide more office space for the CII. In 1986, after a period of refurbishment that redeveloped the conference hall and lower ground floor into a banqueting suite, the Insurance Hall was reopened by the Lord Mayor of London.[6]\nIn 2018 the CII sold Aldermanbury to the Corporation of London and moved to 21 Lombard Street.[7] The CII has since moved again to 20 Fenchurch Street, sharing a floor with the Chartered Institute of Securities and investments[8]\nIn 2020 the Chartered Institute for Securities & Investment and Chartered Insurance Institute both reviewed their property footprints following the pandemic 2020. The CII decided to sub-let part of the CISI's existing office space at the prime location of 20 Fenchurch Street (known as the \u2018walkie talkie\u2019) from early 2021. The arrangement will see the CISI remodeling their existing space in the building to create a new physically separate office for the CII (for a lease of five years) and will form the main headquarters for both international organizations.

It is composed of a blue shield displaying symbols representing the four original classes of insurance:\n\nSalamander representing fire insurance\nThree anchors representing marine insurance\nTwo parallel chains representing accident insurance\nA wheat-sheaf representing life insuranceThe coat of arms was installed on the fa\u00e7ade of the Insurance Hall on its opening in 1934. It was subsequently matriculated in Scotland. Two Scottish Local Institutes obtained the grant of differenced versions, incorporating a castle in Edinburgh and a lamb in Perth.\nThe full display of heraldic attributes, known as achievement, was granted in 1957 to mark the CII's Diamond Jubilee.[1] The additional elements are:\n\nCrown: a Saxon crown and a medieval helmet representing the connection of the site of Aldermanbury with its history, as the area was the site of an Anglo-Saxon fortified residence.[2]\nHelmet: the helmet, made of steel, in profile and with its visor closed, denotes the rank of \u2018gentlemen and esquires\u2019[3] who constituted the CII's member base.\nCrest: the crest takes the shape of a hand grasping a sword by its blade, instead of by its handle, symbolizing the risk-mitigating effects of insurance. It is also intended to represent the sword of St Paul, a feature of the coat of arms of the City of London, which was, and still is, the main center of insurance.[4]\nSupporters: on the right-hand side stands the royal lion of England and on the left-hand side is a bearded unicorn, the symbol of Scotland. Both have silver fishtails, golden fins, and talons to commemorate the institute's overseas activities. The role played by the CII in the education and support of the insurance profession is symbolized by the books held by both supporters.\nMotto: the Latin motto \u2018consilium scientia located beneath the coat of arms. It is interpreted as \u2018counsel and knowledge\u2019, emphasizing the dependence of those working in insurance upon sound knowledge and wise advice, owed as much by the institute to those who seek its aid as by the professional insurer as a member of the institute to its clients (CII). The motto was first used by the CII in a golden badge created for the president in 1926 and was later incorporated in the achievement.[5]A representation of the full achievement of armorial bearings was installed on the rear fa\u00e7ade of the building.\n\n\n== Membership ==\nAt the time that the institute was granted a royal charter in 1912, full membership was only open to \"men working in insurance.\" Following the First World War, in 1919, the ban on women sitting exams was lifted. A year later, 25 women entered the institute. In 1921, the first woman achieved Fellowship.[1] An equal membership fee was introduced in 1966. Until then, apart from diploma holders, women had to pay only a nominal fee to join the \"Lady Members Committee\". The same year, an alternative cheaper 'lady social membership' was also offered by some local institutes, which was purely for organizing and participating in social events.[2]\nBy comparison, today members of the CII are open to anyone connected with insurance or financial services, including students intending to join the profession.\nAs of 2020, the CII has more than 125,000 members.[3]\nThere are eight levels of membership:\n\nOrdinary: individual members who do not hold a CII qualification.\nDiscover: exclusively for secondary school and college teachers and students in the UK and students enrolled on full-time degree courses at UK universities.\nSociety of Mortgage Professionals (SMP) Ordinary: automatic membership for members of the SMP with the designated mortgage qualification.\nCertificate: holders of the CII Certificate in Insurance. Designated by the letters \"Cert CII\".\nDiploma: holders of the CII Diploma in Insurance. Designated by the letters \"Dip CII\".\nAdvanced Diploma: holders of the CII Advanced Diploma in Insurance. Designated by the letters \"ACII\".\nFellowship: holders of the highest CII qualification. Designated by the letters \"FCII\".\nChartered: professional title awarded to members who hold either the Advanced Diploma or Fellowship and have a minimum of five years of industry experience.\n\n\n== Local and affiliated global insurance institutes ==\nEvery CII member in the UK, the Channel Islands, and the Isle of Man is automatically a member of one of 58 local institutes. There are an additional seven associated institutes in Gibraltar and the Republic of Ireland. Members outside of the UK have the option of membership in one of 70 affiliated global insurance institutes.\n\n\n== Library ==\nA strong desire to form a central Insurance Library in London existed before the Charter incorporation in 1912.[1] The objectives of the then Insurance Institute of Great Britain and Ireland included \u2018to encourage the study of all subjects bearing on every branch of insurance, and to form a Library for the use of members\u2019.[2] These objectives were then written into the 1912 Charter as the obligation for the CII to maintain a library of resources related to insurance for the benefit of its members. However, it was not until the opening of the Insurance Hall in 1934 that the Chartered Insurance Institute Library was established. Before that date, federated Insurance Institutes maintained insurance libraries across the UK and Ireland.\nThe CII Library was initially run in conjunction with the Insurance Institute of London library. The original intention was to run both libraries side by side, the London Insurance Institute Library as a lending library for members of that institute and the Chartered Insurance Institute Library as a reference library for all members.[3] Both libraries eventually merged into one single Library that now acts as a central lending library and knowledge service for all members.\nCII membership today gives insurance and personal finance members full access to CII Knowledge Services, including the library, book lending (in the EU/EEA), copies of articles or chapters, and member-only content in our online knowledge bank. (https://www.cii.co.uk/learning/knowledge-services/our-services/)\n\n\n== Museum ==\nThe Museum in Aldermanbury had existed since the opening of the Insurance Hall in 1934.[1] The Museum originally exhibited a 19th-century fire brigade engine which is now housed at the American Museum in Bath. In 1934 the illustrator C. Walter Hodges painted a frieze that surrounds the four walls of the museum area, depicting allegories of marine, fire, accident, and life insurance. The Insurance Hall is designated as a Grade II listed building, in part due to these murals.[2][3] The professional body's move from Aldermanbury to a smaller, more modern space in the city, resulted in the CII launching an \u2018Our History\u2019 website dedicated to bringing the heritage of the organization, and the wider evolution of insurance, to life. The website includes a 360-degree virtual tour of the Insurance Hall and displays the unique stained-glass windows of the historic building as well as the CII's collection of more than 1500 Fire Marks, which were formerly on display in the staircase of the Aldermanbury building. There are also digitalized versions of hundreds of insurance-related documents, dating back as far as 1669, plus rare, no longer in print books, that give valuable insight into past insurance processes. The original 1912 Charter of the Chartered Insurance Institute can also be found on the site.

{"title": "Earthquake insurance", "text": "Earthquake insurance is a form of property insurance that pays the policyholder in the event of an earthquake that causes damage to the property.  Most ordinary homeowners insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage.\nMost earthquake insurance policies feature a high deductible, which makes this type of insurance useful if the entire home is destroyed, but not useful if the home is merely damaged. Rates depend on location and the probability of an earthquake loss. Rates may be lower for homes made of wood, which withstand earthquakes better than homes made of brick.\nIn the past, earthquake loss was assessed using a collection of mass inventory data and was based mostly on experts' opinions. Today it is estimated using a Damage Ratio (DR), a ratio of the earthquake damage money amount to the total value of a building. Another method is the use of HAZUS, a computerized procedure for loss estimation.\nAs with flood insurance or insurance on damage from a hurricane or other large-scale disasters, insurance companies must be careful when assigning this type of insurance, because an earthquake strong enough to destroy one home will probably destroy dozens of homes in the same area. If one company has written insurance policies on numerous homes in a particular city, then a devastating earthquake will quickly drain all the company's resources. Insurance companies devote much study and effort toward risk management to avoid such cases.\nIn the United States, insurance companies stop selling coverage for a few weeks after a sizeable earthquake has occurred. This is because damaging aftershocks can occur after the initial quake, and rarely, it may be foreshock. Although aftershocks are smaller in magnitude, they deviate from the original epicenter. If an aftershock is significantly closer to a populated area, it can cause much more damage than the initial quake. One such example is the 2011 Christchurch earthquake in New Zealand which killed 185 people following a much larger and more distant quake with no fatalities at all.\n\n\n== California ==\nAfter the 1994 Northridge earthquake, nearly all insurance companies completely stopped writing homeowners' insurance policies altogether in the state, because under California law (the \"mandatory offer law\"), companies offering homeowners' insurance must also offer earthquake insurance. Eventually the legislature created a \"mini policy\" that could be sold by any insurer to comply with the mandatory offer law: only earthquake loss due to structural damage need be covered, with a 15% deductible. Claims on personal property losses and \"loss of use\" are limited. The legislature also created a quasi-public (privately funded, publicly managed) agency called the CEA California Earthquake Authority. Membership in the CEA by insurers is voluntary and member companies satisfy the mandatory offer law by selling the CEA mini policy. Premiums are paid to the insurer, and then pooled in the CEA to cover claims from homeowners with a CEA policy from member insurers. The state of California specifically states that it does not back up CEA earthquake insurance, in the event that claims from a major earthquake were to drain all CEA funds, nor will it cover claims from non-CEA insurers if they were to become insolvent due to earthquake losses. [1]\n\n\n== Canada ==\nThere are 4,000 recorded earthquakes in Canada each year. Earthquake damage is not covered by a standard home insurance policy. In the next 50 years, there is a 30% chance of a significant earthquake in British Columbia.\n\n\n== Japan ==\nThe government of Japan created the \"Japanese Earthquake Reinsurance\" scheme in 1966, and the scheme has been revised several times since.  Homeowners may buy earthquake insurance from an insurance company as an optional rider to a fire insurance policy.  Insurers enrolled in the JER scheme who have to pay earthquake claims to homeowners share the risk among themselves and also the government, through the JER.  The government pays a much larger proportion of the claims if a single earthquake causes aggregate damage of over about 1 trillion yen (about US$8.75 billion).  The maximum payout in a single year to all JER insurance claim filers is 5.5 trillion yen (about US$39.4 billion); if claims exceed this amount, then the claims are pro-rated among all claimants.\n\n\n== New Zealand ==\n\nNew Zealand's Earthquake Commission (EQC) is a Government-owned Crown entity which provides primary natural disaster insurance to the owners of residential properties in New Zealand. In addition to its insurance role, EQC also undertakes research and provides training and information on disaster recovery.EQC was established in 1945 as the Earthquake and War Damage Commission, as part of the New Zealand Government, and was originally intended to provide coverage for earthquakes as well as war damage.  Coverage was eventually extended from solely earthquake and war damage to include other natural disasters such as natural landslips, volcanic eruptions, hydrothermal activity, and tsunamis, with coverage for war damage later being removed.  For residential land, storm and flood damage is covered.  Cover extends over fire damage caused by any of these natural disasters.\n\n\n== Turkey ==\n\n\n== Industry ==\nEarthquake insurers use simulations to estimate the risk of an earthquake; companies which do that work include CoreLogic, which acquired earthquake modeler Eqecat in 2013 and AIR Worldwide, which is owned by the insurance analytics firm Verisk Analytics.\n\n\n== See also ==\nEarthquake Commission\nEarthquake engineering\nEarthquake simulation\nGlobal Earthquake Model\nSeismic retrofit\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Quality investing", "text": "Quality investing is an investment strategy based on a set of clearly defined fundamental criteria that seeks to identify companies with outstanding quality characteristics. The quality assessment is made based on soft (e.g. management credibility) and hard criteria (e.g. balance sheet stability). Quality investing supports best overall rather than best-in-class approach.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe idea for quality investing originated in the bond and real estate investing, where both the quality and price of potential investments are determined by ratings and expert attestations. Later the concept was applied to investments in enterprises in equity markets.Benjamin Graham, the founding father of value investing, was the first to recognize the quality problem among equities back in the 1930s. Graham classified stocks as either Quality or Low Quality. He also observed that the greatest losses result not from buying quality at an excessively high price, but from buying Low Quality at a price that seems good value. Warren Buffett said that one wants to buy companies that can be run by idiots, because some day they will be.The quality issue in a corporate context attracted particular attention in the management economics literature following the development of the BCG matrix in 1970. Using the two specific dimensions of life cycle and the experience curve concept, the matrix allocates a company's products \u2013 and even companies themselves \u2013 to one of two quality classes (Cash Cows and Stars) or two Non-quality classes (Question Marks and Dogs). Other important works on quality of corporate business can be found primarily among the US management literature. These include, for example, \"In Search of Excellence\" by Thomas Peters and Robert Waterman, \"Competitive Advantage\" by Michael Porter, \" Built to Last\" by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras, and \"Good to Great\" by Jim Collins. \nand \"Quality Investing\" by Lawrence Cunningham\nQuality investing gained credence in particular after the burst of the Dot-com bubble in 2001 when investors witnessed the spectacular failures of companies such as Enron and Worldcom. These corporate collapses focused investors\u2019 awareness on quality, which may vary from stock to stock. Investors started to pay more attention to quality of balance sheet, earnings quality, information transparency, and corporate governance quality.\n\n\n== Identification of Corporate quality ==\nAs a rule, systematic quality investors identify quality stocks using a defined set of criteria that they have generally developed themselves and revise continually. Selection criteria that demonstrably influence and/or explain a company's business success or otherwise can be broken down into five categories:1. Market Positioning: quality company possesses an economic moat, which distinguishes it from peers and allows to conquer leading market position. The company operates in the industry which offers certain growth potential and has global trends (e.g. ageing population for pharmaceuticals industry) as tailwinds.\n2. Business model: According to the BCG matrix, the business model of a quality company is usually classified as star (growing business model, large capex) or cash cow (established business model, ample cash flows, attractive dividend yield). Having a competitive advantage, quality company offers good product portfolio, well-established value chain and wide geographical span.\n3. Corporate Governance: Evaluation of corporate management execution is mainly based on soft-criteria assessment. Quality company has professional management, which is limited in headcount (6-8 members in top management) and has a low turnover rate. Its corporate governance structure is transparent, plausible and accordingly organized.\n4. Financial Strength: Solid balance sheet, high capital and sales profitability, ability to generate ample cash flows are key attributes of quality company. Quality company tends to demonstrate positive financial momentum for several years in a row. Earnings are of high quality, with operating cash flows exceeding net income, inventories and accounts receivables not growing faster than sales etc.\n5. Attractive valuation: Valuation ultimately is related to quality, which is similar to investments in real estate. Attractive valuation, which is defined by high discounted cash flow (DCF), low P/E ratio and P/B ratio, becomes an important factor in quality investing process.\nAccording to a number of studies the company can sustain its quality for about 11 months in average, which means that quantitative and qualitative monitoring of the company is done systematically.\n\n\n== Comparison to other investment models ==\nQuality investing is an investment style that can be viewed independent of value investing and growth Investing. A quality portfolio may therefore also contain stocks with Growth and Value attributes.\nNowadays, Value Investing is based first and foremost on stock valuation. Certain valuation coefficients, such as the price/earnings and price/book ratios, are key elements here. Value is defined either by valuation level relative to the overall market or to the sector, or as the opposite of Growth. An analysis of the company's fundamentals is therefore secondary. Consequently, a Value investor will buy a company's stock because he believes that it is undervalued and that the company is a good one. A quality investor, meanwhile, will buy a company's stock because it is an excellent company that is also attractively valued.\nModern Growth Investing centers primarily on Growth stocks. The investor's decision rests equally on experts' profit forecasts and the company's earnings per share. Only stocks that are believed to generate high future profits and a strong growth in earnings per share are admitted to a Growth investor's portfolio. The share price at which these anticipated profits are bought, and the fundamental basis for growth, are secondary considerations. Growth investors thus focus on stocks exhibiting strong earnings expansion and high profit expectations, regardless of their valuation. Quality investors, meanwhile, favor stocks whose high earnings growth is rooted in a sound fundamental basis and whose price is justified.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValue investing\nGrowth investing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading =="}
{"title": "Master of Quantitative Finance", "text": "A master's degree in quantitative finance concerns the application of mathematical methods to the solution of problems in financial economics. There are several like-titled degrees which may further focus on financial engineering, computational finance, mathematical finance, and/or financial risk management.\nIn general, these degrees aim to prepare students for roles as \"quants\" (quantitative analysts), including analysis, structuring, trading, and investing; in particular, these degrees emphasize derivatives and fixed income, and the hedging and management of the resultant market and credit risk. \nFormal master's-level training in quantitative finance has existed since 1990.\n\n\n== Structure ==\nThe program is usually one to one and a half years in duration, and may include a thesis component.   Entrance requirements are generally multivariable calculus, linear algebra, differential equations and some exposure to computer programming (usually C++); programs emphasizing financial mathematics may require some background in measure theory.\nInitially, the curriculum builds quantitative skills, and simultaneously develops the underlying finance theory:\n\nThe quantitative component draws on applied mathematics, computer science and  statistical modelling, and emphasizes stochastic calculus, numerical methods and simulation techniques; see Mathematical finance  \u00a7 Mathematical tools. Some programs also focus on econometrics / time series analysis.\nThe theory component usually includes a formal study of financial economics, addressing  asset pricing and financial markets; some programs may also include general coverage of economics, accounting, corporate finance and portfolio management.The components are then integrated, addressing the modelling, valuation and hedging of equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, foreign exchange derivatives, and fixed income instruments and their related credit- and interest rate derivatives; see Mathematical finance  \u00a7 Derivatives pricing.\nPrograms often include dedicated modules in market risk and credit risk, with some degrees offered as specialized \u201cMasters in Financial Risk Management\u201d;\n \nthe techniques covered are  value at risk, stress testing, and \"sensitivities\" analysis, and in parallel, the Basel capital / liquidity requirements.\nIncreasingly, programs include quantitative portfolio management and -optimization; \n\nsee Outline of finance \u00a7 Quantitative investing and \u00a7 Portfolio theory. \nRecently, topics (or specializations) in data science and machine learning are becoming common.The title of the degree will depend on emphasis, the major differences between programs being the curriculum's distribution between mathematical theory, quantitative techniques and financial applications. The more theoretically oriented degrees are usually termed \"Master's in Mathematical Finance\" or \"Master's in Financial Mathematics\" while those oriented toward practice are termed \"Master's in Financial Engineering\" (MFE or MSFE), \"Master's in Computational Finance\" (MCF or MSCF), or sometimes simply \"Master's in Finance\" (MFin). \"Master's in Quantitative Finance\" is the more general degree title, although \"MQF\" degrees are often less theoretical and more practical. The practice oriented programs are often positioned as professional degrees (and in the United States, are sometimes offered as Professional Science Master's). Programs are sometimes offered as a Master of Engineering, \nor as a Master of Operations Research.\n\n\n== Comparison with other qualifications ==\n\nThe program differs from a Master of Science in Finance (MSF), and an MBA in finance, in that these degrees aim to produce finance generalists as opposed to \"quants\", and therefore focus on corporate finance, accounting, equity valuation and portfolio management. The treatment of any common topics\u2014usually \"derivatives\", financial modeling, and risk management\u2014will be less (or even non) technical. Entrance requirements are similarly less mathematical. Note that Master of Finance (M.Fin.) and MSc. in Finance degrees, as distinct from the MSF, may be substantially similar to the MQF.\nThere is some overlap with degrees in actuarial science, and both degrees are occasionally offered by the same department. Nevertheless, the programs are almost always separate and distinct. Specifically, whereas actuarial programs cover risk and uncertainty as applied to pensions, insurance and investments, quantitative finance programs are broader (although offer less depth in these areas), and prepare graduates for various of the highly numerate roles in finance and for other areas that require \"quants\".There is similarly overlap with a Master of Financial Economics, although the emphasis is very different. That degree focuses on the underlying economics, and on developing and testing theoretical models, and aims to prepare graduates for research based roles and for doctoral study.  The curriculum therefore emphasises coverage of financial theory, and of econometrics, while the treatment of model implementation (through mathematical modeling and programming), while important, is secondary. Entrance requirements are similarly less mathematical.  Some Financial Economics degrees are substantially quantitative, and are largely akin to the MQF.\nFor students whose interests in finance are commercial rather than academic, a Master's in Quantitative Finance may be seen as an alternative to a PhD in finance. At the same time though, \"Master's in Mathematical Finance\" programs are often positioned as providing a basis for doctoral study.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe first quantitative finance master's programs in the US were offered by Illinois Institute of Technology in 1990, under Dr. Michael Ong. \nThe programs offered were the \"Master of Science in Quantitative Finance\" and \"Master of Science in Financial Markets and Trading\", and were combined in 2008 to become the \"Master of Science in Finance, with Financial Engineering Concentration\".The NYU-Poly Financial Engineering degree was the second program of its kind, \nand the first to be certified by the International Association of Financial Engineers.Carnegie Mellon introduced its \"Master of Computational Finance\" program in 1994.OGI's Computational Finance Program (1996, now discontinued) was the first such program based in a computer science department. \nOther pioneering programs include those at NYU's Courant Institute, Columbia, Princeton, Cornell, UCLA, DePaul and MIT.Subsequent growth in the number and location of programs has paralleled the growth of financial engineering\u2014with its growing importance across all aspects of the financial services industries\u2014and of risk management as professions.  \nPrograms are now widely offered internationally\u2014see links below\u2014and in some cases are available online or via distance education  \n(e.g. Washington,York,Stevens,USC,NUS,TU Kaiserslautern,). \nIn a few cases, a quantitative-finance MBA-specialization is offered. \n \nMore recently undergraduate programs are available, both in the US \n(e.g. Ball State, James Madison,McIntire.) \nand internationally \n(e.g. Essex,HKUST,UNISA).\n\n\n== See also ==\nCertificate in Quantitative Finance\nFinancial modeling\nList of quantitative analysts\nMaster of Finance\nMaster of Financial Economics\nMathematical finance\nQEM\nQuantitative analyst\nOutline of finance \u00a7 Education\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nFinancial Engineering Core Body of Knowledge, International Association for Quantitative Finance\nListing of academic programs in financial engineering/financial mathematics, International Association for Quantitative Finance"}
{"title": "Dirty price", "text": "The price of a bond is the present value of its future cash-flows. To avoid the impact of the next coupon payment on the price of a bond, this cash flow is excluded from the price of the bond and is called the accrued interest. In finance, the dirty price is the price of a bond including any interest that has accrued since issue of the most recent coupon payment. This is to be compared with the clean price, which is the price of a bond excluding the accrued interest.\n\nDirty Price = Clean Price + Accrued InterestWhen bond prices are quoted on a Bloomberg Terminal, Reuters or FactSet they are quoted using the clean price.\n\n\n== Bond pricing ==\nBonds, as well as a variety of other fixed income securities, provide for coupon payments to be made to bond holders on a fixed schedule.  The dirty price of a bond will decrease on the days coupons are paid, resulting in a saw-tooth pattern for the bond value. This is because there will be one fewer future cash flow (i.e., the coupon payment just received) at that point.\nTo separate out the effect of the coupon payments, the accrued interest between coupon dates is subtracted from the value determined by the dirty price to arrive at the clean price.  The accrued interest is based on the day count convention, coupon rate, and number of days from the preceding coupon payment date.The clean price more closely reflects changes in value due to issuer risk and changes in the structure of interest rates.  Its graph is smoother than that of the dirty price.  Use of the clean price also serves to differentiate interest income (based on the coupon rate) from trading profit and loss.\nIt is market practice in US to quote bonds on a clean-price basis.  When a bond settles the accrued interest is added to the value based on the clean price to reflect the full market value.\n\n\n== Example ==\nA corporate bond has a coupon rate of 7.2% and pays 4 times a year, on the 15th of January, April, July, and October.  It uses the 30/360 US day count convention.\nA trade for 1,000 par value of the bond settles on January 25.   The prior coupon date was January 15.  The accrued interest reflects ten days' interest, or $2.00 = (7.2% of $1,000 * (10 days/360 days)). Thus $2.00 is being paid to the seller as compensation for his or her share of the upcoming interest payment on April 15.\nThe bonds are purchased from the market at $985.50.  Given that $2.00 pays the accrued interest, the remainder ($983.50) represents the underlying value of the bonds. The following table illustrates the values of these terms.\nThe market convention for corporate bond prices assigns a quoted (clean price) of $983.50.  This is sometimes referred to as the price per 100 par value. The standard broker valuation formula (incorporated in the Price function in Excel or any financial calculator, such as the HP10bII) confirms this; the main term calculates the actual (dirty price), which is the total cash exchanged, less a second term which represents the amount of accrued interest. The result, the actual price less accrued interest is referred to as the quoted price. The actual price is a present value amount determined by applying the market rate of interest to the bond\u2019s remaining cash flows. Accrued interest is simply a fractional (last interest date to the settlement date of the entire interest period) portion of an interest payment. Thus, the quoted price cannot be determined independently. Many people are confused by the fact that bonds are sold for \u201cprice plus accrued interest\u201d. However,\u201cprice\u201d here refers to the quoted (clean) price. Thus it is more precise to say that bonds sell for \u201cquoted price plus accrued interest\u201d, not because the quoted price is calculated and then accrued interest is added, but because the quoted price is determined by deducting accrued interest from the calculated actual (dirty) price. \n\n\n== See also ==\nAccrued interest\nBond valuation\nClean price\nDay count convention\n\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n\n== References ==\nCoupon Interest, 2008, retrieved 2008-07-06.

{"title": "Transfer tax", "text": "A transfer tax is a tax on the passing of title to property from one person (or entity) to another.\nIn a narrow legal sense, a transfer tax is essentially a transaction fee imposed on the transfer of title to property from one entity to another. This kind of tax is typically imposed where there is a legal requirement for registration of the transfer, such as transfers of real estate, shares, or bond. Examples of such taxes include some forms of stamp duty, real estate transfer tax, and levies for the formal registration of a transfer. In some jurisdictions, transfers of certain forms of property require confirmation by a notary. While notarial fees may add to the cost of the transaction, they are not a transfer tax in the strict sense of the term.\n\n\n== UK ==\nIn England and Northern Ireland, property transfers between living persons or other legal entities incur a Stamp Duty Land Tax. Similar provisions exist in Scotland and Wales.\nWhen property is transferred from the estate of a deceased person, Inheritance tax is payable on the value of the estate including any property portfolio in that estate, subject to a minimum value threshold.\n\n\n== United States ==\nIn some states, transfer tax is considered to be an excise tax.\nTransfer taxes can be levied at the federal, state and local levels, depending on the type of property being transferred.\n\n\n== Real Estate ==\nReal estate transfer tax can be appointed by the authorities of state, county or commune when a real estate property is being transferred within a certain jurisdiction. Subjected to the tax is usually the act of transfer of legal deeds, certificates and titles to a property that are being shifted between the seller and the buyer. The size of the tax is derived from value of the certain property, its classification and from how the property is going to be used, because the purpose of a property can often greatly affect its future value. Therefore, local and state government are permitted to collect the tax based not only on the size of a property, but also its intended purpose. Classification of properties allows states to put different taxes on different properties in a non-uniform manner. The different classifications are commonly based on either use or ownership. There are two main ways that a state uses to tax in a non-uniform manner and those are by imposing different rates of tax on different types of property, or a uniform rate of tax but giving different types of property a different percentage of value. In some states the buyer may be required to pay the tax if the seller either isn't able to pay themselves or is liberated from it.\nIn the United States, the term transfer tax also refers to Estate tax and Gift tax. Both these taxes levy a charge on the transfer of property from a person (or that person's estate) to another without consideration.  In 1900, the United States Supreme Court in the case of Knowlton v. Moore, 178 U.S. 41 (1900), confirmed that the estate tax was a tax on the transfer of property as a result of a death and not a tax on the property itself. The taxpayer argued that the estate tax was a direct tax and that, since it had not been apportioned among the states according to population, it was unconstitutional. The Court ruled that the estate tax, as a transfer tax (and not a tax on property by reason of its ownership) was an indirect tax. In the wake of Knowlton the Internal Revenue Code of the United States continues to refer to the Estate tax and the related Gift tax as \"Transfer taxes.\"\nThe real estate tax is not imposed by five of the United States of America and those are Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, North Dakota, and Wyoming.\nIn this broader sense, estate tax, gift tax, capital gains tax, sales tax on goods (not services), and certain use taxes are all transfer taxes because they involve a tax on the transfer of title.\nThe United States had a tax on sales or transfers of stock from 1914 to 1966. This was instituted in The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of Oct. 22, 1914 (ch. 331, 38 Stat. 745)), in the amount of 0.02% (2 basis points, bips). This was doubled to 0.04% (4 bips) in 1932, in the context of the Great Depression, then eliminated in 1966.\n\n\n== See also ==\nCurrency transaction tax\nFinancial transaction tax\nInheritance tax\nSpahn tax\nReal estate transfer tax\nStamp duty\nStamp duty in the United Kingdom\nTobin tax\nTurnover tax\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Clean price", "text": "In finance, the clean price is the price of a bond excluding any interest accrued since bond's issuance and the most recent coupon payment. Comparatively, the dirty price is the price of a bond including the accrued interest. Therefore,\n\nClean Price = Dirty Price \u2212 Accrued InterestIn Bloomberg Terminal or Reuters, bond prices are quoted using the clean price. Traders tend to think of bonds in terms of their clean prices.\nClean prices are more stable over time than dirty prices. When clean prices change, it is for an economic reason such as a change in interest rates or the bond issuer's credit quality.  Dirty prices change day to day depending on the date relative to the coupon payment dates, as well as economic reasons.\n\n\n== Example ==\nPrice example:\nXYZ Ltd. issues a bond with a $1000 face value and a $980 published price, with a coupon rate of 5% paid semi-annually and a maturity date of five years. The annual coupon payment is 5% of $1000, or $50. The investor receives a $25 coupon payment every six months until the maturity date. \nIn this case, $980 is the clean price of the bond. The bond price quoted to investors is $980 plus the accrued interest. Brokers quote the dirty price, found by adding the clean price and accrued interest since that day. \nIf the bond's last coupon payment was made on 1 June, on 1 September, the dirty price is: Clean Price + Accrued Interest (where accrued interest is the interest accumulated from 1 June to 31 August on the bond according to its coupon rate.) \nThe price changes continuously, as it depends on how many days have passed since the last coupon payment on the bond.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAccrued interest\nBond\nDirty price\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nCalculation of the clean price of a bond in a cash management bond repurchase operation, Bank of Canada.

{"title": "Investment club", "text": "An investment club is a group of individuals who meet for the purpose of pooling money and investing; members typically meet periodically to make investment decisions as a group through a voting process and recording of minutes, or gather information and perform investment transactions outside the group. In the US the upper limit for the value of an investment club's worth is $25m. There is no lower limit. Investment clubs provide members a means to learn about markets, while meeting and working with people who have similar interests.\n\n\n== History ==\nAlthough people have been investing in groups for thousands of years, the world's first investment club was allegedly established in Texas in 1898 back in the days of the Wild West when few investments could be considered safe. Investment clubs were seen as an ideal way of spreading the risk \u2013 away from just cattle.While the first investment club on record dates back to the 1800s in Western America, various online communities devoted to this type of investing have recently emerged and have contributed to the personal investing boom in the United States. One of the reasons that people come together in investment clubs is to learn how to invest. In Britain investment clubs took off in the 1950s, but the formation rate fell during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\n== Starting an Investment Club ==\nIndustry observers recommend prospective members adhere to these guidelines:\nConsult a tax adviser on the taxation implications of the club's selected legal structure\nEstablish an investment mission, policy and goals that allow active participation before investing\nDraw up a written operating or membership agreement covering asset management rules and membership changes\nEvaluate fees for different tools and platforms to maximize returns.\nFocus on learning and making money.\n\n\n== Club Types ==\n\n\n=== High School Extracurricular Investment Clubs ===\nThis form of investment club usually meets to develop interest in investing and the intricacies of investing for minors, usually high school students. They typically are led by an adult who has experience in professional investing.\n\n\n=== Stock, Mutual Fund or Bond Investment Clubs ===\nThese clubs are groups of people that pool their money to purchase stocks, stock options, mutual funds or bonds. Many clubs are educational in nature with objectives in line with learning how to make smart long-term investments. The National Association of Investors Corporation is a non-profit organization of many investment clubs with this purpose. These clubs may decide to buy or sell investments typically based on a majority votes.\nClub objectives do vary and in the U.S. the Securities and Exchange Commission may require that a club be registered depending on the intent of investment. The SEC distinguishes between clubs on the basis of several laws including the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, which are concerned with whether the club issues membership interests that are effectively securities.\nClub officers and members are not normally required to hold a securities license as long as they refrain from soliciting compensation in exchange for financial advice or soliciting the sale of stock, mutual funds or bonds in third party companies. One allowed exception is that a CEO / President or CFO of a C Corporation is allowed to solicit stock or bonds in their corporation as long as they provide a private placement memorandum that complies with the law to their new shareholders. One additional requirement is that non-accredited investors must be Directors of the C Corporation in addition to being shareholders.\n\n\n=== Real Estate Investment Clubs ===\nClubs of this type are most commonly publicized as a real estate investment group or company, rather than a club. The legal distinction according to the SEC is having 100 members or less. Whereas, a real estate investment group would normally have more than 100 investors. These clubs normally buy real estate or notes (loans originated by a licensed third party) to benefit from: cash flow, appreciation of assets, instant equity, tax benefits from deductions or qualified dividends, group buying power, monthly or daily compounding, higher liquidity and diversification of risk. Real estate transactions are limited to 35 participants to meet the legal requirements of many states for being closely held, and can be legally organized as a sole proprietorship transferring assets to a group living trust, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, general partnership or C corporation.\n\n\n=== Business Investment Clubs ===\nThese clubs are often called incubators and are formed to purchase businesses that generate cash flow and equity. Investment types range from a group of people buying lower risk franchises with at least two years of significant revenues and positive cash flow like major fast food franchises, gas stations and hotels to higher risk businesses without an income history like start-ups, inventions, or product patenting and prototype development.\n\n\n=== Hybrid Investment Clubs ===\nHybrid clubs are a combination of two or more of the above types of investment clubs. Typically, real estate investment clubs are lower in risk and provide higher returns of 21% to 70% than stock, mutual fund or bond investment clubs due to the ongoing need for housing and population growth. Business investment clubs have about equal risk when compared to stock, mutual fund or bond investment clubs. However, business investment clubs have several additional benefits which include significantly higher returns and lower operating expenses measured by the net profit per year divided by the amount of cash necessary to purchase the business. Additionally, you can also hire yourself or family members to work in the business as employees.\n\n\n=== Self-directed investment clubs ===\nA self-directed investment club is a type of investment club in which members do not make financial contributions, but rather meet on a regular or informal basis to share stock tips and advice, and then invest in their individual portfolios, not in a common club portfolio (as is more typical of investment clubs). The phrase was coined by financial author and investment club expert Douglas Gerlach in Investment Clubs for Dummies.\n\n\n== Conduct of business ==\nIn order to operate an investment club, business must be conducted in a somewhat orderly fashion.  The level of formality will vary based on the club type.  A typical club will have informal channels of communication via mailing lists, Twitter accounts or message boards.  In addition to the informal channels of communication, an investment club must set up formal channels of communication to conduct business.  Typically, this is done with monthly meetings.  A typical meeting agenda will include all the normal activity you would expect in an organization with elected officials.  A typical meeting agenda:\nRoll call\nOld business \u2013 list of any unfinished business from the previous meeting.\nSummary of votes \u2013 Summary of all voted decisions from the previous meeting\nNAV presentation \u2013 NAV or the Net Asset Value of the Club will indicate what each club member is worth on paper.\nAvailable funds \u2013 a presentation of Available funds to invest.\nPresentation of current research \u2013 each member assigned to present an investment option will present his/her research.\nVote to hold or invest \u2013 A vote to hold cash, sell current assets or invest in one of the investment options\nInvestment vote \u2013 A final vote on an investment strategy specifying an exact amount to invest and strategy to execute that investment.\nOther business \u2013 Typically, other business will include proxy voting needs or other day-to-day business operational needs.  This could also include options to change a brokerage house, or discussions of counter party risk.\nFormal close of meeting\n\n\n== Legal structure ==\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nInvestment clubs are normally unincorporated associations. Members\u2019 contributions are converted into \u2018units\u2019 whose value rises and falls in line with the value of the underlying investments. The clubs are not taxed corporately, and members should account individually for their share of profits and capital gains.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nInvestment clubs are generally formed as general partnerships, but could also be formed as limited liability companies, limited liability partnerships, corporations, or sole proprietorship that transfer real estate assets to a group living trust (similar to a family trust). While an investment club could incorporate, the double tax treatment on corporate distributions makes the corporate structure less desirable than a partnership except in the case when a C Corporation pays out qualified dividends after deducting allowable expenses. Typically, a general partnership does not generate any tax liability on its own; instead, any tax liability is passed through to members each year. However, income taxes are generally much higher than taxes on qualified dividends.\nIn order to understand the legal structure that an investment club should choose, the club should first understand its club type.  Each of the different club types will have different legal requirements as well as different reporting requirements. Typically, the SEC only requires reporting for investment groups with over 100 members, which is reclassified as an investment group, not an investment club. Publicly held offerings like a Real Estate Investment Trust as known as a REIT also have additional reporting requirements.\n\n\n== Tax implications ==\nInvestment club accounting software can facilitate the management of a club's books and the preparation of tax filings.\nIn the United States Investment club partnerships may have to file Form 1065 and Schedule K-1s with the IRS each year, and with States that require partnership filings.In the United Kingdom investment clubs and their members are required to submit form 185(new) to HMRC each year.\n\n\n== See also ==\nList of finance topics\nVoleo which has developed mobile and web apps for investment clubs\n\n\n== External links ==\nInvestment clubs and the SEC A FAQ on investment clubs provided by the SEC\nStories from over 100 investment clubs about their experiences\nProshare, a UK promotional body for investment clubs\nTop 5 way to Earn Online Money from Home\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nInvestment Clubs for Dummies by Douglas Gerlach and Angele McQuade (ISBN 0-7645-5409-3), published in 2001\n\n\n== Reference Section =="}
{"title": "Market portfolio", "text": "Market portfolio is a portfolio consisting of a weighted sum of every asset in the market, with weights in the proportions that they exist in the market, with the necessary assumption that these assets are infinitely divisible.Richard Roll's critique states that this is only a theoretical concept, as to create a market portfolio for investment purposes in practice would necessarily include every single possible available asset, including real estate, precious metals, stamp collections, jewelry, and anything with any worth, as the theoretical market being referred to would be the world market.There is some question of whether what is used for the market portfolio really matters. Some authors say that it does not make a big difference; you can use any representative index and get similar results. Roll gave an example where different indexes produce much different results, and that by choosing the index you can get any ranking you want. Brown and Brown (1987) examine this, using different indexes such as stocks only, stocks and bonds, and stocks plus bonds plus real estate. They find that using a market that includes real estate produces much different results. For example, with one measurement most mutual funds have alpha close to zero, while with another measurement most of them have significantly negative alpha.\nMost index providers give indices for different components such as stocks only, bonds only, et cetera. As a result, proxies for the market (such as the FTSE 100 in the UK, DAX in Germany or the S&P 500 in the US) are used in practice by investors.  Roll's critique states that these proxies cannot provide an accurate representation of the entire market.\nThe concept of a market portfolio plays an important role in many financial theories and models, including the capital asset pricing model where it is the only fund in which investors need to invest, to be supplemented only by a risk-free asset, depending upon each investor's attitude towards risk.\nSharpe (2010) notes that many investors are at least targeted to a fixed ratio (e.g. 60% stocks, 40% bonds). He points out that this is sort of contrarian. The holdings of all investors combined must, by equation, be in the cap-weighted proportions. So many investors following this strategy implies some other investors must follow a buy-high, sell-low (trend following) strategy. He then says that he doesn't like it and people should use adjustments to the market proportions instead.The portfolio of the average investor contains important information for strategic asset allocation purposes. This portfolio shows the relative value of all assets according to the market crowd, which one could interpret as a benchmark for the average investor. Several authors have collected data to determine the composition of the global market portfolio since 1960.The returns on the market portfolio realizes a compounded real return of 4.43% with a standard deviation of 11.2% from 1960 until 2017. In the inflationary period from 1960 to 1979, the compounded real return of the GMP is 3.24%, while this is 6.01% in the disinflationary period from 1980 to 2017. The reward for the average investor is a compounded return of 3.39%-points above the risk-free rate.\n\n\n== See also ==\nAsset allocation\nCapital market line\nCapital allocation line\nSecurity market line\nSecurity characteristic line\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nThe Market Portfolio May be Mean-Variance Efficient After All"}
{"title": "Reference rate", "text": "A reference rate is a rate that determines pay-offs in a financial contract and that is outside the control of the parties to the contract. It is often some form of LIBOR rate, but it can take many forms, such as a consumer price index, a house price index or an unemployment rate.  Parties to the contract choose a reference rate that neither party has power to manipulate.\n\n\n== Examples of use ==\nThe most common use of reference rates is that of short-term interest rates such as LIBOR in floating rate notes,  loans, swaps, short-term interest rate futures contracts, etc. The rates are calculated by an independent organisation, such as the British Bankers Association (BBA) as the average of the rates quoted by a large panel of banks, to ensure independence.\nAnother example is that of swap reference rates for constant maturity swaps. The ISDAfix rates used are calculated daily for an independent organisation, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, from quotes from a large panel of banks.\nIn the credit derivative market a similar concept to reference rates is used. Pay offs are not determined by a rate, but by possible events. In this case, the reference event has to be a very precisely defined credit event, to make sure there can be no disagreement on whether the event has occurred or not..\nTypically the benchmark LIBOR is the three-month rate.\n\n\n== Reference rates for short-term interest rates ==\nExamples of reference rates for short-term interest rates are:\n\nLIBOR - London Interbank Offered Rate.

The organization  works internationally with partners to establish ethical and professional standards across the sector around the world. The limited company was formed in 2023, providing training programs for students, and took over the taught degree awarding powers formerly held by the registered educational charity, incorporated by royal charter, now known as the London Foundation for Banking & Finance.  It runs the Student Investor Challenge, an initiative in the financial education sector. As of 2023, the Institute has awarded a Young Financial Journalist of the Year award.\n\n\n== History ==\nThe London Institute of Banking & Finance was established in 1879 as the Institute of Bankers. It was established by bank workers who saw a need for professional standards and education in the industry. This idea received relative popularity, gaining 2,000 members by the end of its first year. The first exams took place in 1880 and were opened to women in 1917 \u2013 a year before women were given the vote in the UK.\nThe institute gained a royal charter in 1987 becoming the Chartered Institute of Bankers and in 1993 merged with the Chartered Building Societies Institute.\nIn 1996, the Institute offered its first degree \u2013 the BSc (Hons) in Financial Services \u2013 offered as a dual award with the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. It was the first professional award to be linked to a university degree.\nThe name changed in 1997 to the Institute of Financial Services. In the same year, the Certificate in Mortgage Advice and Practice (CeMAP) was introduced \u2013 this was the first qualification for UK mortgage professionals.In 2001 the Institute launched the first personal finance qualifications for young people in the UK, equivalent to an AS-level.

{"title": "Business interruption insurance", "text": "Business interruption insurance (also known as business income insurance) is a type of insurance that covers the loss of income that a business suffers after a disaster. The income loss covered may be due to disaster-related closing of the business facility or due to the rebuilding process after a disaster. \nIt differs from property insurance in that a property insurance policy only covers the physical damage to the business, while the additional coverage allotted by the business interruption policy covers the profits that would have been earned. This extra policy provision is applicable to all types of businesses, as it is designed to put a business in the same financial position it would have been in if no loss had occurred.This type of coverage can be added onto the business's property insurance policy or comprehensive package policy such as a business owner's policy (BOP) or as part of a standalone policy in some jurisdictions.  Since business interruption is included as part of the business's primary policy, it only pays out if the cause of the loss is covered by the overarching policy or a defined event in the case of a standalone.\n\n\n== Coverage ==\nThe following are typically covered under a business interruption insurance policy:\n\nProfits. Profits that would have been earned (based on prior months' financial statements).\nFixed costs. Operating expenses and other costs still being incurred by the property (based on historical costs).\nTemporary location. Some policies cover the extra expenses for moving to, and operating from, a temporary location.\nCommission and training cost. Business Interruption (BI) policy essentially covers the cost of providing training to the operators of the machinery replaced by the insurer following the insured events.\nExtra expenses. Reimbursement for reasonable expenses (beyond the fixed costs) that allow the business to continue operation while the property is being repaired.\nCivil authority ingress / egress. Government-mandated closure of business premises that directly causes loss of revenue. Examples include forced business closures because of government-issued curfews or street closures related to a covered event.This coverage extends until the end of the business interruption period determined by the insurance policy. Most insurance policies define this period as starting on the date of the covered peril and the damaged property is physically repaired and returned to operations under the same condition that existed prior to the disaster.In addition, businesses can purchase contingent business interruption coverage, which pays out when a business is unable to operate because of an event (such as a natural disaster) that damages the business premises of one of its suppliers or customers, thus preventing it from engaging in normal trade.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nAirmic Property Damage and Business Interruption Benchmarking Report 2012P&C Insurance: The Conundrum of Business Interruption Coverage during the Coronavirus Pandemic"}
{"title": "Risk factor (finance)", "text": "In finance, risk factors are the building blocks of investing, that help explain the systematic returns in equity market, and the possibility of losing money in investments or business adventures. A risk factor is a concept in finance theory such as the capital asset pricing model, arbitrage pricing theory and other theories that use pricing kernels.  In these models, the rate of return of an asset (hence the converse its price) is a random variable whose realization in any time period is a linear combination of other random variables plus a disturbance term or white noise. In practice, a linear combination of observed factors included in a linear asset pricing model (for example, the Fama\u2013French three-factor model) proxy for a linear combination of unobserved risk factors if financial market efficiency is assumed. In the Intertemporal CAPM, non-market factors proxy for changes in the investment opportunity set.Risk factors occur whenever any sort of asset is involved, and there are many forms of risks from credit, liquidity risks to investment and currency risks.\nDifferent participants of risk factors contain different risk factors for each participant, for example, financial risks for the individual, financial risks for the Market, financial risks for the Government etc.\n\n\n== Financial risks for the individual ==\nFinancial risks for individuals occur when they make sub-optimal decisions. There are several types of Individual risk factors; pure risk, liquidity risk, speculative risk, and currency risk. Pure Risk is a type of risk where the outcome cannot be controlled, and only has two outcomes which are complete loss or no loss at all. An example of pure risk for an individual would be owning an equipment, there is risk of it being stolen and there would be a loss to the individual, however, if it weren't stolen, there is no gain but only no loss for the individual. Liquidity Risk is when securities cannot be purchased or sold fast enough to cut losses in a volatile market. An example to which an individual might experience liquidity risk would be no one willing to purchase a security you own, and the value of your security significantly drops. Speculative risks are made based on conscious choices, and results in an uncertain degree of gain or loss. An example of speculative risk is purchasing stocks, the future of the stock's price is uncertain, and both a gain or loss could occur depending on whether if the stock price rises or decreases. Currency risk is when exchange rates changes will affect the profitability of when one is committed to it and the time when it is carried out. An example of currency risk would be if interest rates were higher in U.S compared to Australia, the Australian dollar would drop in comparison to the U.S. This is due to the increase in demand for USD as investors take advantage of higher yields, thus exchange rate fluctuates and the individual is exposed to risks in the foreign exchange markets.\n\n\n== Financial risks for the market ==\nFinancial Risks for the market are associated with price fluctuation and volatility. Risk factors consist of interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity and stock prices, and through their non-stop fluctuations, it produces a change in the price of the financial instrument. Market Risk (systematic risk) is the risk an investor experiences when the value of an investment decreases due to financial market factors. The failure of a single company or cluster of companies could lead to the entire market crashing and the way to reduce this risk is through diversification into assets that are not co-related to the market. An example is during the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, when a core sector of the market suffered, the volatile risk created effected the monetary well-being of the entire marketplace. During this time, businesses closed, there was an estimated loss of $6 trillion to $14 trillion, and governments were forced to rethink their economic policies. A similar situation is observed during the COVID-19 global pandemic crisis, where a massive economic fall-out had occurred due to the lack of economic activity. The global economy came to a halt, aggregate demand rapidly decreased, and even oil prices plummeted to almost negative $40, which meant producers paid buyers to take oil off their hands as storing oil was costly.\n\n\n== Financial risks for businesses ==\nFinancial Risk for businesses rises due to the need for funding in order to expand and grow the business, or when they sell products on credit. There are several types of financial risks in businesses, including credit risks, specific risks, and operational risks. Credit risk are the dangers of default occurring when a creditor lends money to a borrower. Examples of credit risks include businesses not being able to retrieve their money when they sell products on credit and may experience a rise in costs to collect the debt. Businesses can also experience credit risk as the borrowers, as they must manage cash flows in order to pay back their accounts payable (Chen, 2019) (Maverick, 2020) (LaBarre, 2020). Specific risks a.k.a. unsystematic risks are hazards that are unique and apply only to a certain asset or company. An example of an unsystematic risk is if a company has poor reputation or there are strikes among company employees, only that specific company is affected. Unsystematic risk can be avoided through diversification where, where investors invest in a wide variety of stocks. Companies face operational risks whenever it attempts to do ordinary business activities and can also be classified as a variety of specific risk. Operational risks stem from man-made choices, thus are the risks of business operations failing due to human error. Examples of Operational risks would be keeping a subpar sales staff team as it has lower wage costs, but it comes with higher operational risks as the staff are more likely to make mistakes.\n\n\n== Financial risks in investing ==\nInvesting is allocating money, effort, or time into something in hopes of generating income or profit. A common investment is investing in stocks, purchasing them at a low price then reselling it later at a higher price to earn the difference as profit. Stock investing comes with very high risks as every single piece of information would cause market prices to fluctuate.\n\n\n=== Economic risk ===\nOne of the most obvious risk is economic risk, where the economy could go bad at any given moment, causing stock prices to plummet.\n\n\n=== Commodity price risk ===\nCommodity price risk is the possibility of a commodity price fluctuating, potentially causing financial losses for the buyers or producers of a commodity. As Commodity prices are basic raw materials, it creates a domino effect, affecting all products that require the commodity. For example, oil consumers often face commodity price risk, as oil is a widely used necessity product currently, many producers\u2019 profits are affected by the fluctuation of oil price.\n\n\n=== Inflationary risk and interest rate risk ===\nOther risks like inflationary risk and interest rate risks usually go hand in hand, as interest rates are increased in order to combat inflation, which in turn causes businesses operation cost to increase, making it harder to stay in business, which then leads to a reduction in their stock prices. Inflation on its own also destroys value of stocks and creates recessions in the market.\n\n\n=== Headline risk ===\nA very transparent risk is headline risk, where any stories in the media that will damage a company's reputation would hurt their business and reduce their stock prices. An example is the Fukushima nuclear crisis in 2011, which punished their stocks and caused excessive backlash against any businesses related to the story.\n\n\n=== Obsolescence risk ===\nA risk that arises due to technological advancement is obsolescence risk, where a process, product or technology used by a company to generate profit becomes obsolete as competitors find cheaper alternatives. An example of this are publishing companies, as computers, phones, and devices becomes more advanced, more and more people read news, magazines and books online instead of the printed form as it's cheaper and more convenient, which caused publishing companies to slowly become obsolete.\n\n\n=== Model risk ===\nWhen people rely too much on the assumptions underlying economic and business models is model risk. When the models are inaccurate, all stakeholders that relied on the financial model are exposed to risks as the quantitative information utilized are made based on insufficient information. An example of this is the Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) debacle, which caused them great financial loss because of a small error in their computer models, which was magnified by their highly leveraged trading strategy.\n\n\n== Financial risks for the government ==\nGovernment involved risk rises in a two-way factor; first is the Government's policies which create interest rate and aggregate demand fluctuations, and the second is investing directly in Government bonds.\n\n\n=== Government policies ===\nGovernment enforces policies and regulations, to which businesses must oblige to be able to fairly compete against each other. From time to time, the government changes these frameworks which creates risks for businesses as they are forced to adapt and change how they operate. The government changes their policies depending on the current economic situation, in order to stimulate economic growth and maintain a healthy level of inflation. The change in interest rates would cause aggregate demand to increase or decrease, forcing the market to adjust to the new equilibrium in the long run. For example, if the government were to increase interest rates, business sales would decrease, due to people more willing to save, and vice versa. Another fiscal policy example would be if the government were to increase their spending, it would increase aggregate demand, and cause business sales to increase. The reserve banks have a role in mitigating the financial risks that would create financial disturbances and systematic consequences.\n\n\n=== Government bonds ===\nWhen an individual or group purchases a government bond, they lend money to the government, and in return they get paid a promised interest rate. Investing in government bonds is generally safer than stocks but still contains risks, e.g. interest rate risks where market rates rise and we could be earning more in investing in other investments, inflation risks where a higher inflation reduces the amount earned from interest, liquidity risks where no one wants to buy the bonds when we want to sell it, and chances that the government loses control of their monetary policy and default on their bonds.\n\n\n== Tools to control financial risk ==\nThe most common tools/methods used to control financial risk are risk analysis, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, and quantitative analysis. Fundamental analysis is a method that looks at a business's fundamental financial level, revenue, expenses, growth prospects and then measures the securities intrinsic value. By measuring the securities intrinsic value, they are able to predict the stock price movements and reduce potential risk factors. Technical analysis is a method that utilizes past prices, statistics, historical returns, share prices, etc., to evaluate securities. Through technical analysis, investors are able to determine the volatility and momentum of the securities, thus reducing financial risks when they decide on who the invest. Quantitative analysis is the process of gathering data in numerous fields and evaluating their historical performance through financial ratio calculations. For example certain ratios like debt-to-capital ratio, or capital expenditure ratio are utilized to measure a company's performance and then using the data to determine the risk factors of investing in this company.\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Bond option", "text": "In finance, a bond option is an option to buy or sell a bond at a certain price on or before the option expiry date. These instruments are typically traded OTC.\n\nA European bond option is an option to buy or sell a bond at a certain date in future for a predetermined price.\nAn American bond option is an option to buy or sell a bond on or before a certain date in future for a predetermined price.Generally, one buys a call option on the bond if one believes that interest rates will fall, causing an increase in bond prices. Likewise, one buys the put option if one believes that interest rates will rise. One result of trading in a bond option, is that the price of the underlying bond is \"locked in\" for the term of the contract, thereby reducing the credit risk associated with fluctuations in the bond price.\n\n\n== Valuation ==\n\nBonds, the underlyers in this case, exhibit what is known as pull-to-par: as the bond reaches its maturity date, all of the prices involved with the bond become known, thereby decreasing its volatility. On the other hand, the Black\u2013Scholes model, which assumes constant volatility, does not reflect this process, and cannot therefore be applied here; [1] see Black\u2013Scholes model #Valuing bond options.\nAddressing this, bond options are usually valued using the Black model or with a lattice-based short-rate model such as Black-Derman-Toy, Ho-Lee or Hull\u2013White. [2] The latter approach is theoretically more correct, [3], although in practice the Black Model is more widely used for reasons of simplicity and speed. For American- and Bermudan- styled options, where exercise is permitted prior to maturity, only the lattice-based approach is applicable.\n\nUsing the Black model, the spot price in the formula is not simply the market price of the underlying bond, rather it is the forward bond price. This forward price is calculated by first subtracting the present value of the coupons between the valuation date (i.e. today) and the exercise date from today's dirty price, and then forward valuing this amount to the exercise date. (These calculations are performed using today's yield curve, as opposed to the bond's YTM.) The reason that the Black Model may be applied in this way is that the numeraire is then $1 at the time of delivery (whereas under Black\u2013Scholes, the numeraire is $1 today). This allows us to assume that (a) the bond price is a random variable at a future date, but also (b) that the risk-free rate between now and then is constant (since using the forward measure moves the discounting outside of the expectation term [4]).  Thus the valuation takes place in a risk-neutral \"forward world\" where the expected future spot rate is the forward rate, and its standard deviation is the same as in the \"physical world\"; [5] see Girsanov's theorem. The volatility used, is typically \"read-off\" an Implied volatility surface.The lattice-based model entails a tree of short rates \u2013 a zeroeth step \u2013 consistent with today's yield curve and short rate (often caplet) volatility, and where the final time step of the tree corresponds to the date of the underlying bond's maturity. Using this tree (1) the bond is valued at each node by \"stepping backwards\" through the tree: at the final nodes, bond value is simply face value (or $1), plus coupon (in cents) if relevant; at each earlier node, it is the discounted expected value of the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, plus coupon payments during the current time step. Then (2), the option is valued similar to the approach for equity options:  at nodes in the time-step corresponding to option maturity, value is based on moneyness; at earlier nodes, it is the discounted expected value of the option at the up- and down-nodes in the later time step, and, depending on option style (and other specifications \u2013 see below), of the bond value at the node. [6] [7]  For both steps, the discounting is at the short rate for the tree-node in question. (Note that the Hull-White tree is usually Trinomial: the logic is as described, although there are then three nodes in question at each point.) See Lattice model (finance)#Interest rate derivatives.\n\n\n== Embedded options ==\nThe term \"bond option\" is also used for option-like features of some bonds (\"embedded options\"). These are an inherent part of the bond, rather than a separately traded product. These options are not mutually exclusive, so a bond may have several options embedded. [8] Bonds of this type include:\n\nCallable bond: allows the issuer to buy back the bond at a predetermined price at a certain time in future. The holder of such a bond has, in effect, sold a call option to the issuer. Callable bonds cannot be called for the first few years of their life. This period is known as the lock out period.\nPuttable bond: allows the holder to demand early redemption at a predetermined price at a certain time in future. The holder of such a bond has, in effect, purchased a put option on the bond.\nConvertible bond: allows the holder to demand conversion of bonds into the stock of the issuer at a predetermined price at a certain time period in future.\nExtendible bond: allows the holder to extend the bond maturity date by a number of years.\nExchangeable bond: allows the holder to demand conversion of bonds into the stock of a different company, usually a public subsidiary of the issuer, at a predetermined price at certain time period in future.Callable and putable bonds can be valued using the lattice-based approach, as above, but additionally allowing that the effect of the embedded option is incorporated at each node in the tree, impacting the bond price and / or the option price as specified. [9] These bonds are also sometimes valued using Black\u2013Scholes. Here, the bond is priced as a \"straight bond\" (i.e. as if it had no embedded features) and the option is valued using the Black Scholes formula.  The option value is then added to the straight bond price if the optionality rests with the buyer of the bond; it is subtracted if the seller of the bond (i.e. the issuer) may choose to exercise. [10] [11] [12] For convertible and exchangeable bonds, a more sophisticated approach is to model the instrument  as a \"coupled system\" comprising an equity component and a debt component, each with different default risks; see Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid securities.\n\n\n== Relationship with caps and floors ==\nEuropean Put options on zero coupon bonds can be seen to be equivalent to suitable caplets, i.e. interest rate cap components, whereas call options can be seen to be equivalent to suitable floorlets, i.e. components of interest rate floors. See for example Brigo and Mercurio (2001), who also discuss bond options valuation with different models.\n\n\n== References ==\n\nBlack, F.; Derman, E.; Toy, W.

{"title": "Terrorism insurance", "text": "Terrorism insurance is insurance purchased by property owners to cover their potential losses and liabilities that might occur due to terrorist activities.\nIt is considered to be a difficult product for insurance companies, as the odds of terrorist attacks are very difficult to predict and the potential liability enormous. For example, the September 11, 2001 attacks resulted in an estimated $31.7 billion loss. This combination of uncertainty and potentially huge losses makes the setting of premiums a difficult matter. Most insurance companies therefore exclude terrorism from coverage in casualty and property insurance, or else require endorsements to provide coverage.\n\n\n== Industry needs ==\nConcentration of risk is another factor in determining availability for terrorism insurance. Due to the concentrated losses of the World Trade Center, carriers were hit with large losses in one centralized location. Insurers seek to spread the coverage over a wider geographic area than as with other aggregate perils, such as flood.\n\n\n== Modelling the risks ==\nInsurance companies are using an approach that is similar to that used with natural catastrophe risks. A Swiss report suggested that in this case where demand is greater than the supply for terrorism coverage that a short-term solution is possible: a mix of government and private resource to make easy the transition. In this situation, the government would serve two functions: to establish rules to overcome the capacity shortage and to be the insurer of last resort.\n\n\n== By country ==\n\n\n=== France ===\nIn France, a pool of insurers and reinsurers was set up on 1 January 2002 under the name Gestion de l'Assurance et de la R\u00c9assurance des risques attentats et Actes de Terrorisme (GAREAT). GAREAT is constituted upon the principle of mutuality between its Members, all of whom are jointly liable, and relies on the support given to GAREAT by international reinsurers as well as by the French State which provides unlimited coverage to the GAREAT programme via unlimited treaties reinsured 100% by Caisse Centrale de R\u00e9assurance (CCR). As a non-profit-making Economic Interest Grouping mandated by its Members, GAREAT returns to the latter that part of the premiums which are not used to finance the reinsurance coverage at the close of each year.\n\n\n=== Germany ===\nThe Extremus Versicherung, founded in 2002, is a private company that insures terrorism risks in Germany. While the first 2.5 billion \u20ac in damages are covered by the insurance, the German government guarantees a further 6.5 billion \u20ac in insurance pay-outs.\n\n\n=== Netherlands ===\nInsurance payments related to terrorism are restricted to a billion euro per year for all insurance companies together. This regards property insurance, but also life insurance, medical insurance, etc.\n\n\n=== Iraq ===\nThe New York Times reports that in Baghdad personal terrorism insurance is available. One company offers such insurance for $90, and if the customer is a victim of terrorism in the next year, it pays the heirs $3,500.\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn 2002, the US Congress enacted the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, in which the government shared the cost of large insurance losses.On December 26, 2007, the President of the United States signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007 which extends the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA) through December 31, 2014. The law extends the temporary federal Program that provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism.Some economists have supported U.S. government subsidies of terrorism insurance.  Soon after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, economist Edwin Mills expressed concern over whether private developers could build real estate without subsidies for insurance.  Economist David R. Barker argued that properly structured subsidies could increase overall economic efficiency.  Other economists have argued against these subsidies.The United States insurance market offers coverage to the majority of large companies which ask for it in their policies. The price of the policy depends on where the clients are residing and how much limit they buy.\n\nAccording to The Economist, one of the best studies to understand TRIA has been the one undertaken in 2005 by the Center for Risk Management at the Wharton Business School (\"TRIA and Beyond\"; available on their website below).\nIn mid-2007 the idea of another extension to TRIA was tabled and is officially known as TRIREA, (Terrorism Risk Insurance Revision and Extension Act). Initially TRIREA contained several new provisions including a mandatory 'make available' clause for NCBR coverage (Nuclear, Chemical, Biological and Radiological) and the ending of the distinction between domestic and foreign events.\nThe act expired on December 31, 2014, but was renewed at the start of the next congress, with Obama signing the extension of the TIRA through 2020 on January 12, 2015. Up until the 2014 expiration, many experts warned that \"construction projects could be stalled and commercial loans on shopping malls, utilities and skyscrapers could be in jeopardy.\" In addition, according to the Baltimore Sun, the National Football League denied rumors that it would cancel the Super Bowl over the issue.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the UK, following the Baltic Exchange bomb in 1992, all UK insurers stopped including terrorism coverage on their commercial insurance policies with effect from 1 January 1993 (home insurance policies were unaffected).  As a consequence, the government and insurance industry established the Pool Reinsurance Company Ltd (Pool Re). Primarily funded by premiums paid by policyholders, the government guarantees the fund although any such support must be repaid from future premiums. To date, despite paying over \u00a3600 million in relation to thirteen separate claims, no government support has been necessary.\n\n\n== Countries with long-term terrorism insurance programmes ==\nAccording to the policy agenda of The Real Estate Roundtable, long-term terrorism insurance is available in the following countries:\n\nAustralia\nAustria\nFinland\nFrance\nGermany\nIsrael\nNamibia\nNetherlands\nRussia\nSouth Africa\nSpain\nSwitzerland\nTurkey\nUnited Kingdom\nIndia\n\n\n== See also ==\nSecurity\nGeneva Association (also known as the International Association for the Study of Insurance Economics)\nPool Re\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nTerrorism from the Insurance Information Institute\nPolicy Watch: Challenges for Terorrism Risk Insurance in the United States (Wharton's authors)\nTerrorism Insurance: Where's the coverage?\nAmerica Needs Terrorism Insurance\nTerrorism Insurance: Where Do We Go from Here?

{"title": "Income approach", "text": "The income approach is one of three major groups of methodologies, called valuation approaches, used by appraisers.  It is particularly common in commercial real estate appraisal and in business appraisal.  The fundamental math is similar to the methods used for financial valuation, securities analysis, or bond pricing.  However, there are some significant and important modifications when used in real estate or business valuation.\nWhile there are quite a few acceptable methods under the rubric of the income approach, most of these methods fall into three categories:  direct capitalization, discounted cash flow, and gross income multiplier.\n\n\n== Direct Capitalization ==\nThis is simply the quotient of dividing the annual net operating income (NOI) by the appropriate capitalization rate (CAP rate).  For income-producing real estate, the NOI is the net income of the real estate (but not the business interest) plus any interest expense and non-cash items (e.g. -- depreciation) minus a reserve for replacement.  The CAP rate may be determined in one of several ways, including market extraction, band-of-investments, or a built-up method.  When appraising complex property, or property which has a risk-adjustment due to unusual factors (e.g. -- contamination), a risk-adjusted cap rate is appropriate.  An implicit assumption in direct capitalization is that the cash flow is a perpetuity and the cap rate is a constant.  If either cash flows or risk levels are expected to change, then direct capitalization fails and a discounted cash flow method must be used.\nIn UK practice, Net Income is capitalised by use of market-derived yields. If the property is rack-rented then the All Risks Yield will be used. However, if the passing rent differs from the Estimated Rental Value (ERV), then either the Term & Reversion, Layer or Equivalent Yield methods will be employed. In essence, these entail discounting the different income streams - that of the current or passing rent and that of the reversion to the full rental value - at different adjusted yields.\nHowever, capitalization rate inherently includes the investment-specific risk premium. Each investor may have a different view of risk and, therefore, arrive at a different capitalization rate for a given investment. The relationship becomes clear when the capitalization rate is derived from the discount rate using the build-up cost of capital model. The two are identical whenever the earnings growth rate equals 0.\n\n\n== Discounted Cash Flow ==\nThe Discounted cash flow model is analogous to net present value estimation in finance.  However, appraisers often mistakenly use a market-derived cap rate and NOI as substitutes for the discount rate and/or the annual cash flow.  The Cap rate equals the discount rate plus-or-minus a factor for anticipated growth.  The NOI may be used if market value is the goal, but if investment value is the goal, then some other measure of cash flow is appropriate.\n\n\n== Gross Rent Multiplier ==\nThe GRM is simply the ratio of the monthly (or annual) rent divided into the selling price.  If several similar properties have sold in the market recently, then the GRM can be computed for those and applied to the anticipated monthly rent for the subject property.  GRM is useful for rental houses, duplexes, and simple commercial properties when used as a supplement to other more well developed methods.\n\n\n== Short-cut DCF ==\nThe Short-cut DCF method is based on a model developed by Professor Neil Crosby of the University of Reading (and ultimately based on earlier work by Wood and Greaves). The RICS have encouraged use of the method in appropriate circumstances. The Short-cut DCF is an adaptation to property valuation of the DCF method, which is widely used in finance.In the Short-cut DCF, the passing rent, which is constant (in nominal or real terms) for the duration of the rent period, is discounted at an appropriate rate of return (possibly derived by reference to the risk-free rate of return obtained on government bonds, to which is added an allowance for risk and an allowance for the illiquidity of property assets). The reversion is discounted at the market-derived All Risks Yield (ARY), which correctly implies growth in the reversionary income stream. The reversionary income is the current Estimated Rental Value (ERV) inflated by an appropriate annual growth factor (or CAGR - Compound Annual Growth Rate). The crux of the Crosby-Wood model, and that which sets it apart from the customary DCF, is that the growth factor is derived by means of formula, as a function of the rate of return and the All Risks Yield. For example, if the rate of return is 10% per annum, the ARY is 8% per annum and rent is reviewed annually, then the growth factor will be 2%. (This simple subtraction only works when rent is reviewed annually - in all other situations the growth factor is derived by use of the Crosby formula.) Thus the Short-cut DCF produces a mathematically consistent valuation and country\n\n\n== See also ==\nGerman income approach\n\n\n== Further reading ==\nBaum, A. and Mackmin, D.

{"title": "Quantitative fund", "text": "A quantitative fund is an investment fund that uses quantitative investment management instead of fundamental human analysis.\n\n\n== Investment process ==\nSee Outline of finance  \u00a7 Quantitative investing for a listing of relevant articles.An investment process is classified as quantitative when investment management is fully based on the use of mathematical and statistical methods to make investment decisions. If investment decisions are based on fundamental analysis and human judgement, the process is classified as fundamental. The quantitative investment process, essentially, breaks down into three key components:\n\nInput system: Providing all necessary inputs such as market data and rules (see financial data vendor);\nForecasting engine: Generating estimations for prices and returns and also, risk parameters;\nPortfolio construction engine: portfolio composition using optimizers or a heuristics-based system (see Portfolio optimization and Mathematical tools).Quantitative portfolio managers and quantitative analysts usually require a strong background in mathematics and computer science, besides knowledge of the academic financial literature. Many quantitative specialists have a PhD in Financial Economics, Engineering or Mathematics. In depth knowledge is needed to as the investment algorithms employ advanced optimization methods using the latest academic insights. Statistical models are used to explore profits that may be made out of systematic market abnormalities which can be very fast such and requires high-frequency trading, but can also be slower requiring less turnover when the alpha is based on factor investing.\n\n\n== History and performance ==\nHedge funds have been driving the growth of quantitative funds over the past decades. A good description of the history of hedge funds can be found in the book  \"More Money than God\". Several of these early funds were quantitatively managed. Over the past two decades quantitatively managed funds have become popular as an increasing number of asset managers adopted quantitative investing and launched a wide range mutual funds as well as exchange traded funds. Most quantitative funds are equity funds, besides fixed income quantitative funds which have become more popular in the past years. After the sub-prime mortgage market turbulence, which cast long shadows over many parts of the financial industry, the total mutual fund asset that employ quantitative model is estimated to be over US$400 billion at the end of June 2016.  As of 2019 the figure was to surpass the $1tn management mark in 2018. Quantitative investing accounts for 16 percent of actively managed assets in the U.S. in 2006, up from 13 percent in 2003, according to Vanguard.Many quantitative funds were able to deliver high long-term risk-adjusted returns profiting from the positive exposure of factors such as value, momentum, low-volatility and quality. This positive performance gave rise to the further growth of quantitative funds. Performance of several well-known quant factors was weak in the period 2018-2020, a period also referred to as the 'quant winter'.\n\n\n== Fund structures ==\nQuantitative strategies are offered in different type of fund structures: \n\nHedge fund. The first quantitative funds were offered as hedge funds and not available to a broad public. The goal of those funds is to earn an absolute return with little constraints and freedom to apply leverage, shorting and derivatives.\nMutual fund. With the increasing popularity of quant investing, quant strategies were also wrapped into mutual funds. Quant mutual funds aim to deliver alpha on top of a benchmark usually a stock market index.\nExchange traded fund (ETF). After hedge funds and mutual funds, quant strategies were also wrapped into exchange traded funds usually tracking a rules-based factor-based index. These strategies are also referred to as 'smart-beta' strategies.Hedge funds have most investment freedom and can employ varieties of strategies such as market neutral, statistical arbitrage, or high-frequency trading strategies to enhance the return of one's portfolio, whereas ETFs are most constrained. \n\n\n== List of notable quantitative funds ==\nThe following firms are known for their quantitative funds. \n\nThe largest asset managers such as 'big three' BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard also offer quantitative funds to investors.\n\n\n== See also ==\nValue investing\nMomentum investing\nLow-volatility investing\nFactor investing\nGrowth investing\n\n\n== References =="}

{"title": "Adjusted present value", "text": "Adjusted present value (APV) is a valuation method introduced in 1974 by Stewart Myers. The idea is to value the project as if it were all equity financed (\"unleveraged\"), and to then add the present value of the tax shield of debt \u2013 and other side effects.Technically, an APV valuation model looks similar to a standard DCF model. However, instead of WACC, cash flows would be discounted at the unlevered cost of equity, and tax shields at either the cost of debt (Myers) or following later academics also with the unlevered cost of equity. APV and the standard DCF approaches should give the identical result if the capital structure remains stable.According to Myers, the value of the levered firm (Value levered, Vl) is equal to the value of the firm with no debt (Value unlevered, Vu) plus the present value of the tax savings due to the tax deductibility of interest payments, the so-called value of the tax shield (VTS). Myers proposes calculating the VTS by discounting the tax savings at the cost of debt (Kd). The argument is that the risk of the tax saving arising from the use of debt is the same as the risk of the debt.The method is to calculate the NPV of the project as if it is all-equity financed (so called \"base case\"). Then the base-case NPV is adjusted for the benefits of financing. Usually, the main benefit is a tax shield resulted from tax deductibility of interest payments. Another benefit can be a subsidized borrowing at sub-market rates. The APV method is especially effective when a leveraged buyout case is considered since the company is loaded with an extreme amount of debt, so the tax shield is substantial.\n\n\n== See also ==\nLeverage (finance)\nHamada's equation\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Calmar ratio", "text": "Calmar ratio (or Drawdown ratio) is a performance measurement used to evaluate Commodity Trading Advisors and hedge funds. It was created by Terry W. Young and first published in 1991 in the trade journal Futures.Young owned California Managed Accounts, a firm in Santa Ynez, California, which managed client funds and published the newsletter CMA Reports. The name of his ratio \"Calmar\" is an acronym of his company's name and its newsletter: CALifornia Managed Accounts Reports. Young defined it thus:\n\nThe Calmar ratio uses a slightly modified Sterling ratio \u2013 average annual rate of return for the last 36 months divided by the maximum drawdown for the last 36 months \u2013 and calculates it on a monthly basis, instead of the Sterling ratio's yearly basis.\nYoung believed the Calmar ratio was superior because\n\nThe Calmar ratio changes gradually and serves to smooth out the overachievement and underachievement periods of a CTA's performance more readily than either the Sterling or Sharpe ratios.\nIt should be mentioned that a competitor newsletter, Managed Account Reports (founded in 1979 by publisher Leon Rose), had previously defined and popularized another performance measurement, the MAR Ratio, equal to the compound annual return from inception, divided by the maximum drawdown from inception.\nAlthough the Calmar ratio and MAR ratio are sometimes assumed to be identical, they are in fact different: Calmar ratio uses 36 months of performance data, whereas MAR ratio uses all performance data from inception onwards. Later versions of the Calmar ratio introduce the risk free rate into the numerator to create a Sharpe type ratio.\n\n\n== See also ==\nModigliani risk-adjusted performance\nOmega ratio\nRisk return ratio\nSharpe ratio\nSterling ratio\nSortino ratio\n\n\n== References =="}

This financial ratio is most commonly used for industries which require a large percentage of revenues to maintain operations, such as railroads.

It is calculated by dividing the operating expenses by the net sales. The smaller the ratio, the greater the organization's ability to generate profit. The ratio does not factor in expansion or debt repayment.Alternatively, it may be expressed as a ratio of sales to cost.

{"title": "Constant maturity swap", "text": "A constant maturity swap, also known as a CMS, is a swap that allows the purchaser to fix the duration of received flows on a swap.\nThe floating leg of an interest rate swap typically resets against a published index. The floating leg of a constant maturity swap fixes against a point on the swap curve on a periodic basis.\nA constant maturity swap is an interest rate swap where the interest rate on one leg is reset periodically, but with reference to a market swap rate rather than LIBOR. The other leg of the swap is generally LIBOR, but may be a fixed rate or potentially another constant maturity rate. Constant maturity swaps can either be single currency or cross currency swaps. Therefore, the prime factor for a constant maturity swap is the shape of the forward implied yield curves. A single currency constant maturity swap versus LIBOR is similar to a series of differential interest rate fixes (or \"DIRF\") in the same way that an interest rate swap is similar to a series of forward rate agreements. Valuation of constant maturity swaps depend on volatilities of different forward rates and therefore requires a stochastic yield curve model or some approximated methodology like a convexity adjustment, see for example Brigo and Mercurio (2006).\n\n\n== Example ==\nA customer believes that the six-month LIBOR rate will fall relative to the three-year swap rate for a given currency.

{"title": "Heterogeneity in economics", "text": "In economic theory and econometrics, the term heterogeneity refers to differences across the units being studied. For example, a macroeconomic model in which consumers are assumed to differ from one another is said to have heterogeneous agents.\n\n\n== Unobserved heterogeneity in econometrics ==\n\nIn econometrics, statistical inferences may be erroneous if, in addition to the observed variables under study, there exist other relevant variables that are unobserved, but correlated with the observed variables; dependent and independent variables .Methods for obtaining valid statistical inferences in the presence of unobserved heterogeneity include the instrumental variables method; multilevel models, including fixed effects and random effects models; and the Heckman correction for selection bias.\n\n\n== Economic models with heterogeneous agents ==\n\nEconomic models are often formulated by means of a representative agent. Depending on the application, individual agents can be aggregated to or represented by a single agent. For example, individual demand can be aggregated to market demand if and only if individual preferences are of the Gorman polar form (or equivalently satisfy linear and parallel Engel curves). Under this condition, even heterogeneous preferences can be represented by a single aggregate agent simply by summing over individual demand to market demand. However, some questions in economic theory cannot be accurately addressed without considering differences across agents, requiring a heterogeneous agent model. \nHow to solve a heterogeneous agent model depends on the assumptions that are made about the expectations of the agents in the model. Broadly speaking, models with heterogeneous agents fall into the category of agent-based computational economics (ACE) if the agents have adaptive expectations (see artificial financial market), or into the category of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) if the agents have rational expectations. DSGE models with heterogeneneous agents are especially difficult to solve, and have only recently become a widespread topic of research; most early DSGE research instead focused on representative agent models.\n\n\n=== Methods for solving DSGE models with heterogeneous agents ===\nHeathcote, Storesletten and Violante (AEJ Macro 2009) make convenient functional form assumptions that allow for some dimensions of heterogeneity but nonetheless maintain an analytical solution for the general equilibrium.\nKrusell and Smith (JPE 1998) permit an arbitrary distribution of wealth but assume all prices and equilibrium variables are approximately functions of the mean or of a few other statistics of that distribution.\nAlgan, Allais, and den Haan (2009) approximate the distribution by a parameterized distributional form at all times.\nReiter (JEDC 2009) and Mertens and Judd (mimeo 2011) develop perturbation methods for approximating the dynamics of the distribution under arbitrary distributional forms.\n\n\n== See also ==\nRepresentative vs. heterogeneous agents in economics\nAgent-based computational economics\nNew Keynesian economics (2010s)\nEconomic inequality\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Owner earnings", "text": "Owner earnings is a valuation method detailed by Warren Buffett in Berkshire Hathaway's annual report in 1986. He stated that the value of a company is simply the total of the net cash flows (owner earnings) expected to occur over the life of the business, minus any reinvestment of earnings.Buffett defined owner earnings as follows:\n\n\"These represent (a) reported earnings plus (b) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges ... less (c) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume ... Our owner-earnings equation does not yield the deceptively precise figures provided by GAAP, since (c) must be a guess - and one sometimes very difficult to make. Despite this problem, we consider the owner earnings figure, not the GAAP figure, to be the relevant item for valuation purposes ... All of this points up the absurdity of the 'cash flow' numbers that are often set forth in Wall Street reports. These numbers routinely include (a) plus (b) - but do not subtract (c).\"\n\n\n== Estimating Average Capital Expenditures ==\nAverage annual capital expenditures is, as Buffett mentions, an estimate. This number may be separated into maintenance capital expenditure (what's required to keep the business operating at current levels) and growth capital expenditure (what's required to grow the business). The most straightforward way to calculate maintenance capital expenditure is to simply use depreciation, amortization, and depletion. But those numbers don't necessarily reflect reality since depreciation schedules and the like don't necessarily line up with their actual useful lives. Similarly, simply using the most recent period's capital expenditure may not be representative of the annual capital expenditure required to run the business and it may also include a portion of \"growth\" capital expense.\nOne way, as proposed by Bruce Greenwald, to approximate maintenance capital expenditure, for use in an owner earnings calculation is to use a ratio of capital expenditure to sales over multiple past years. As formulated by Greenwald, this approximation works by:\nSum of property, plant, and equipment (PPE) from the balance sheet for the past 5 years\nSum sales from the income statement for the past 5 years\nDividing the sum of PPE by the sum of sales to find the average ratio of PPE-to-sales\nMultiply the PPE-to-sales ratio by the nominal increase or decrease in sales from the prior year to the current year to find growth capital expenditure\nSubtract calculated growth capital expenditure from the current year's capital expense on the balance sheet to find maintenance capital expenditure.\n\n\n== See also ==\nBerkshire Hathaway\nBusiness valuation\nCash flow forecasting\nValuation (finance)\nValue investing\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Digging into Buffett's numbers\". 11 May 2005.\n\"Checklist: Tenets of the Warren Buffett Way\"."}
{"title": "Basis swap", "text": "A basis swap is an interest rate swap which involves the exchange of two floating rate financial instruments.  A basis swap functions as a floating-floating interest rate swap under which the floating rate payments are referenced to different bases.The existence of a basis arises from demand and supply imbalances and where, for example, a basis is due for a borrower seeking dollars, this is indicative of a synthetic dollar interest rate in the FX market pricing higher than the direct dollar interest rate. The existence of the basis is a violation of the covered interest rate parity (CIP) condition.\n\n\n== Usage of basis swaps for hedging ==\nBasis risk occurs for positions that have at least one paying and one receiving stream of cash flows that are driven by different factors and the correlation between those factors is less than one. Entering into a Basis Swap may offset the effect of gains or losses resulting from changes in the basis, thus reducing basis risk.\n\nagainst exposure to currency fluctuations (for example, 1 mo USD LIBOR for 1 mo GBP LIBOR)\nagainst one index in the favor of another (for example, 1 mo USD T-bill for 1 mo USD LIBOR)\ndifferent points on a yield curve (for example, 1 mo USD LIBOR for 6 mo USD LIBOR)\n\n\n== Basis swaps in energy commodities ==\nIn energy markets, a basis swap is a swap on the price differential for a product and a major index product (e.g. Brent Crude or Henry Hub gas).\n\n\n== See also ==\nInterest rate swap\nBasis trading\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Inventory optimization", "text": "Inventory optimization is a method of balancing capital investment constraints or objectives and service-level goals over a large assortment of stock-keeping units (SKUs) while taking  demand and supply volatility into account.\n\n\n== Inventory management challenges ==\nEvery company has the challenge of matching its supply volume to customer demand. How well the company manages this challenge has a major impact on its profitability. In contrast to the traditional \"binge and purge\" inventory cycle in which companies over-purchase product to prepare for possible demand spikes and then discards extra product, inventory optimization seeks to more efficiently match supply to expected customer demand. APQC Open Standards data shows that the median company carries an inventory of 10.6 percent of annual revenues as of 2011. The typical cost of carrying inventory is at least 10.0 percent of the inventory value. So the median company spends over 1 percent of revenues carrying inventory, although for some companies the number is much higher.Also, the amount of inventory held has a major impact on available cash. With working capital at a premium, it\u2019s important for companies to keep inventory levels as low possible and to sell inventory as quickly as possible. When Wall Street analysts look at a company\u2019s performance to make earnings forecasts and buy and sell recommendations, inventory is always one of the top factors they consider. Studies have shown a 77 percent correlation between overall manufacturing profitability and inventory turns.The challenge of managing inventory is increased by the \u201cLong Tail\u201d phenomenon which is causing a greater percentage of total sales for many companies to come from a large number of products, each with low sales frequency. Shorter and more frequent product cycles which are required to meet the needs of more sophisticated markets create the need to manage supply chains containing more products and parts. Hence, businesses need to understand how this affects their inventory and how they can seize the opportunities presented by such products.At the same time, planning frequencies and time-buckets are moving from monthly/weekly to daily and the number of managed stocking locations from dozens in distribution centers to hundreds or thousands at the points of sale (POS). This leads to a large number of time series with a high level of demand volatility. This explains one of the main challenges in managing modern supply chains, the so-called \u201cbullwhip effect\u201d, which often causes small changes in actual demand to cause a much larger change in perceived demand, which in turn can mislead companies to make bigger changes in inventory than are really necessary.\n\n\n== Non-optimized approach ==\nWithout inventory optimization, companies commonly set inventory targets using rules of thumb or single stage calculations. Rules of thumb normally involve setting a number of days of supply as a coverage target. Single stage calculations look at a single item in a single location and calculate the amount of inventory required to meet demand.\n\n\n== Deterministic vs. stochastic ==\nInventory optimization models can be either deterministic\u2014with every set of variable states uniquely determined by the parameters in the model \u2013 or stochastic\u2014with variable states described by probability distributions. Stochastic optimization takes supply uncertainty into account that, for example, 6 percent of orders from an overseas supplier are 1\u20133 days late, 1 percent are 4\u20136 days late, 5 percent are 7\u201314 days late and 8 percent are more than 14 days late.Stochastic optimization also accounts for demand volatility which is a top priority among the challenges faced by supply chain professionals. For example, management predicts a 65 percent probability of selling 500 units, a 20 percent probability of selling 400 units and a 15 percent probability of selling 600 units. High service levels can be achieved with cost overruns, excessive inventory and firefighting, but higher profitability can be achieved by understanding the sources of volatility and planning appropriately. The result is a better understanding of the inventory requirements than with a deterministic approach.\n\n\n== Single vs. multi-echelon ==\nSingle-echelon location problems are single-type problems such that either the material flow coming out or the material flow entering the facilities to be located is negligible. In multiple-echelon problems, both inbound and outbound commodities are relevant. This is the case, for example, when distribution centers (DCs) have to be located taking into account both the transportation cost from plants to DCs and the transportation cost from DCs to customers. In multiple-echelon problems, constraints aiming at balancing inbound and outbound flows have to be considered.A sequential single-echelon approach forecasts demand and determines required inventory for each echelon separately. Multi-echelon inventory optimization determines the correct levels of inventory across the network based on demand variability at the various nodes and the performance (lead time, delays, service level) at the higher echelons.Multi-echelon inventory optimization looks at inventory levels holistically across the supply chain while taking into account the impact of inventories at any given level or echelon on other echelons. For example, if the product sold in a retailer\u2019s outlet is received from one of its distribution centers, the distribution center represents one echelon of the supply chain and the outlet another one. It should be clear that the amount of stock needed at the outlets is a function of the service received from the distribution center. The better the service that is provided upstream, the smaller the protection that is needed downstream.  The goal of multi-echelon inventory optimization is to continually update and optimize safety stock levels across all of these echelons.Multi-echelon inventory optimization represents the state of the art approach to optimize inventory across the end to end supply chain. Modeling multiple stages allows other types of inventory, including cycle stock and prebuild along with safety stock due to time phased demands, to be accurately predicted. As part of inventory optimization, supplier performance, customer service and internal asset metrics should be continuously monitored to enable continuous improvement.\n\n\n== Benefits ==\nCompanies have achieved financial benefits by employing inventory optimization. A study by IDC Manufacturing Insights found that many organizations that utilized inventory optimization reduced inventory levels by up to 25 percent in one year and enjoyed a discounted cash flow above 50 percent in less than two years.Electrocomponents, a United Kingdom based world\u2019s largest distributor of electronics and maintenance products, increased profits by \u00a336 million by using inventory optimization to achieve higher service levels while reducing inventory. Castrol used inventory optimization to reduce finished goods inventory by an average of 35 percent in two years while increasing service levels (defined as line fill rates) by 9 percent. Smiths Medical, a division of Smiths Group, used inventory optimization to better address demand volatility and supply variability, thus reducing the risk of both understocks and overstocks while smoothing out manufacturing cycles.\n\n\n== See also ==\nInventory\nInventory theory\nSupply chain management\nLogistics\nMathematical optimization\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Personal financial management", "text": "Personal financial management refers to \"ways\" or \"methods\" of managing ones own personal finances.  It is also known by its acronym, PFM, which refers to the type of software used for personal finance apps.  Simply put, PFM refers to software that helps users manage their money. PFM often lets users categorize transactions and add accounts from multiple institutions into a single view. PFM also typically includes data visualizations such as spending trends, budgets and net worth.\n\n\n== History ==\nPFM started in 1983 with the founding of Intuit. Scott Cook and Tom Proulx, the company\u2019s founders, witnessed the rise of the personal computer and saw an opportunity to develop personal financial software. Their flagship product, Quicken, became a standard for many households and was eventually followed by QuickBooks, which helped small businesses manage their finances.Around the same time, a similar competing product introduced by MECA Software, conceived by MECA President Gerald Rubin, and designed by author Andrew Tobias called Managing-Your-Money (MYM) came out, first running on the Apple-II, and later the IBM-PC. Later in 1990 Microsoft released their own PFM platform called Microsoft Money.\nMicrosoft worked with Intuit and CheckFree in 1997 to create Open Financial Exchange (OFX), which allowed financial institutions to exchange data with web users, paving the way for online PFM software. Yodlee was founded in 1999. Originally a site that let users view email, banking, news, travel, and shopping in one place, it soon pivoted to focus exclusively on banking, allowing users to view their financial accounts from different institutions all at once.\nA wave of online PFM tools launched around 2006, with Wesabe and Mint at the forefront. Mint was acquired by Intuit in 2009 for $170 million, and Wesabe went under in 2010. Wesabe\u2019s CEO cited the fact that Mint automatically aggregated accounts and transactions as a key reason that Wesabe lost market share to Mint.\nSince 2008, PFM has expanded in scope. Financial advisory companies such as LearnVest, Personal Capital and Credit Karma integrate PFM into their software.Nowadays, there are also other companies providing personal financial management platform products for banks and fintech companies, such as Meniga, Moneythor, MX, Strands, Coinscrap Finance and Tink among others.\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Stylized fact", "text": "In social sciences, especially economics, a stylized fact is a simplified presentation of an empirical finding. Stylized facts are broad tendencies that aim to summarize the data, offering essential truths while ignoring individual details.\nA prominent example of a stylized fact is: \"Education significantly raises lifetime income.\" Another stylized fact in economics is: \"In advanced economies, real GDP growth fluctuates in a recurrent but irregular fashion\".\nHowever, scrutiny to detail will often produce counterexamples. In the case given above, holding a PhD may lower lifetime income, because of the years of lost earnings it implies and because many PhD holders enter academia instead of higher-paid fields. Nonetheless, broadly speaking, people with more education tend to earn more, so the above example is true in the sense of a stylized fact.\n\n\n== Origin of the term ==\nWhen describing what is generally regarded as the first econometric macro model ever developed, Jan Tinbergen (1936) introduces the concept of stylization as follows: \"To get a clear view, stylisation is indispensable. The many phenomena must be grouped in such a way that the picture becomes clear, yet without losing its characteristic traits. Of course every stylisation is a hazardous venture. The art of the social economist's work lies in this stylisation. Some stylisations have been unwieldy, others have been unrealistic. But stylisation is essential. The alternative is barrenness.\" \nThe term \"stylised facts\" was introduced by the economist Nicholas Kaldor in the context of a debate on economic growth theory in 1961, expanding on model assumptions made in a 1957 paper.\nCriticizing the neoclassical models of economic growth of his time, Kaldor argues that theory construction should begin with a summary of the relevant facts. However, to handle the problem that \"facts as recorded by statisticians, are always subject to numerous snags and qualifications, and for that reason are incapable of being summarized\",\nhe suggests that theorists \"should be free to start off with a stylised view of the facts \u2013 i.e. concentrate on broad tendencies, ignoring individual detail\".\nWith respect to broad tendencies that result from such a process, Kaldor coins the term \"stylized facts\".\n\n\n== Examples ==\nStylized facts are widely used in economics, in particular to motivate the construction of a model and/or to validate it. Examples are:\n\nStock returns are uncorrelated and not easily forecastable.\nYield curves tend to move in parallel.\nEducation is positively correlated to lifetime earnings\nInventory behavior of firms: \"the variance of production exceeds the variance of sales\"\n\n\n== Uses ==\nAlready in the original paper, Kaldor used his stylized facts of economic growth to argue in favor of his suggested model in comparison to older neoclassical models of economic growth. This idea has been highlighted subsequently by Boland, that the advantages of one model over the other can be set in a clear perspective via the reference of the stylized facts the respective models can explain. Additionally, stylized facts can be used to look \"under the hood of models\", i.e. be used to validate assumptions of model in a focused way. This can be of particular importance in more complex models. Econophysics/Statistical finance begins from stylized facts. Furthermore, the considerable potential of Stylized Facts for Information Systems research has been investigated and discussed in recent years.\n\n\n== Criticism and derivation ==\nAlready in an early response Solow pinpointed a possible problem of stylized facts, by stating that there \"is no doubt that they are stylized, though it is possible to question whether they are facts\". The criticized practice of deriving stylized facts ad hoc is still quite prevalent in economics. Still, some possible approaches to derive stylized facts from empirical evidence have been suggested, such as surveying experts, statistically analysing large data sets (especially suitable for financial markets) or aggregating both qualitative and quantitative data from different empirical methods by following a systematic process.\n\n\n== See also ==\nMathiness\nIdealised population\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Walrasian auction", "text": "A Walrasian auction, introduced by L\u00e9on Walras, is a type of simultaneous auction where each agent calculates its demand for the good at every possible price and submits this to an auctioneer. The price is then set so that the total demand across all agents equals the total amount of the good. Thus, a Walrasian auction perfectly matches the supply and the demand.\nWalras suggested that equilibrium would always be achieved through a process of t\u00e2tonnement (French for \"trial and error\"), a form of hill climbing. More recently, however, the Sonnenschein\u2013Mantel\u2013Debreu theorem proved that such a process would not necessarily reach a unique and stable equilibrium, even if the market is populated with perfectly rational agents.\n\n\n== Walrasian auctioneer ==\nThe Walrasian auctioneer is the presumed auctioneer that matches supply and demand in a market of perfect competition. The auctioneer provides for the features of perfect competition: perfect information and no transaction costs. The process is called t\u00e2tonnement, or groping, relating to finding the market clearing price for all commodities and giving rise to general equilibrium.\nThe device is an attempt to avoid one of deepest conceptual problems of perfect competition, which may, essentially, be defined by the stipulation that no agent can affect prices. But if no one can affect prices no one can change them, so prices cannot change. However, involving as it does an artificial solution, the device is less than entirely satisfactory.\n\n\n== As a mistranslation ==\nUntil Walker and van Daal's 2014 translation (retitled Elements of Theoretical Economics), William Jaff\u00e9's Elements of Pure Economics (1954) was for many years the only English translation of Walras's \u00c9l\u00e9ments d\u2019\u00e9conomie politique pure.\nWalker and van Daal argue that the idea of the Walrasian auction and Walrasian auctioneer resulted from Jaff\u00e9's mistranslation of the French word crieurs (criers) into auctioneers. Walker and van Daal call this \"a momentous error that has misled generations of readers into thinking that the markets in Walras's model are auction markets and that he assigned the function of changing prices in his model to an auctioneer.\"\n\n\n== See also ==\nDouble auction\nWalras' law\nFisher market - a different market model.\nArrow-Debreu market - yet another market model.\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Bibliography ==\nAckerman, Frank (2002). \"Still dead after all these years: interpreting the failure of general equilibrium theory\" (PDF).

{"title": "Long-term liabilities", "text": "Long-term liabilities, or non-current liabilities, are liabilities that are due beyond a year or the normal operation period of the company. The normal operation period is the amount of time it takes for a company to turn inventory into cash. On a classified balance sheet, liabilities are separated between current and long-term liabilities to help users assess the company's financial standing in short-term and long-term periods. Long-term liabilities give users more information about the long-term prosperity of the company, while current liabilities inform the user of debt that the company owes in the current period. On a balance sheet, accounts are listed in order of liquidity, so long-term liabilities come after current liabilities. In addition, the specific long-term liability accounts are listed on the balance sheet in order of liquidity. Therefore, an account due within eighteen months would be listed before an account due within twenty-four months. Examples of long-term liabilities are bonds payable, long-term loans, capital leases, pension liabilities, post-retirement healthcare liabilities, deferred compensation, deferred revenues, deferred income taxes, and derivative liabilities.\n\n\n== Exceptions ==\nIf a liability is currently due in fewer than twelve months and is in the process of being refinanced so that it is due after a year, then a company can record this debt in long-term investments. Additionally, if a liability is to be covered by a long-term investment, it can be recorded as a long-term liability even if it is due in the current period.

{"title": "Conglomerate discount", "text": "Conglomerate discount is an economic concept describing a situation when the market values a diversified group of businesses and assets at less than the sum of its parts. The explanation of this phenomenon comes from a conglomerate's inability to manage various and different businesses as well as do focused companies. Therefore, the market penalizes a multi-division firm and attaches a lower multiple to its earnings and cash flows, thus creating the discount. However, the opposite concept, called conglomerate premium, also exists.\n\n\n== Developed vs emerging markets ==\nIn the developed economies, the average value of the discount may be 13\u201315% relative to single-segment competitors. Because of the discount, conglomerates have become much less common in the developed markets than they once were. Only several star performers, such as Berkshire Hathaway, have managed to escape the market\u2019s critical assessment of overdiversification. However, conglomerates are still common in a number of emerging markets. The conglomerate discount is substantially bigger in the U.S. and Western Europe than is in Asian countries. This situation may be explained by the fact that in Asian countries a big conglomerate with political connections and an understanding of how to operate in a difficult market can spread its expertise across many industries. In fact, there is a conglomerate premium of 10.9% in Latin America, according to Citigroup. This may be the reason why, in some markets, conglomerates are becoming even larger and more diversified. For example, Samsung Electronics is moving into pharmaceuticals.\n\n\n== Calculation ==\nThe conglomerate discount is usually calculated by adding estimations of the intrinsic values of each of the subsidiary companies in a conglomerate and subtracting the conglomerate's market capitalization from that sum. See Sum-of-the-parts analysis.\n\n\n== Deconglomeration ==\nDeconglomeration and focusing on one or a few businesses via various corporate restructurings may remove such discount and get better value recognition for each of the parts and may also help each business pursue independent strategies. Therefore, identifying and removing a conglomerate discount may be a profitable investment strategy. Recent examples of Deconglomeration in the US include ITT, Motorola, Fortune Brands, Marathon Oil, Genworth, and Sara Lee Corporation. The results have generally been quite positive. For example, ITT\u2019s shares went up by some 11% on the breakup announcement, creating roughly $1B in value.\n\n\n== See also ==\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nConglomerate Discount or Premium?\nHolding structure \u2013 from Conglomerate Discount to Management Value Added"}

{"title": "Credit counseling", "text": "Credit counseling (known in the United Kingdom as debt counseling) is commonly a process that is used to help individual debtors with debt settlement through education, budgeting and the use of a variety of tools with the goal to reduce and ultimately eliminate debt. Credit counseling is most often done by Credit counseling agencies that are empowered by contract to act on behalf of the debtor to negotiate with creditors to resolve debt that is beyond a debtor's ability to pay. Some of the agencies are non-profits that charge at no or non-fee rates, while others can be for-profit and include high fees. Regulations on credit counseling and Credit counseling agencies varies by country and sometimes within regions of the countries themselves. In the United States, individuals filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy are required to receive counseling.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nIn the United States, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling was established in 1951. The modern practice known as \u2018\u2018credit counseling\u2019\u2019 was initiated by creditor banks and credit card companies during the mid-1960s to address the growing volume of personal bankruptcies.Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of home loans, credit card debt and car loans. Credit counseling includes an array of services to address consumer debt that is not within the debtor's ability to pay, such as education about credit personal finance, budgeting and debt management. In addition to education, a popular credit counseling option is the \u2018\u2018Debt management plan\u2019\u2019 (\u2018\u2018DMP\u2019\u2019, known in the United Kingdom as the Individual voluntary arrangement or \"IVA\"). In order to initiate a DMP, a consumer would authorize the credit counselor to contact each of the consumer\u2019s unsecured creditors and negotiate with each creditor to lower the consumer\u2019s monthly payment amount, to lower the interest rate, and to waive any outstanding late fees. The debt was then \u2018\u2018consolidated\u2019\u2019 into a single payment.Credit counselors can sometimes negotiate debt relief, where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven. Another option is Debt consolidation, in which one new loan replaces multiple unsecured credit debts. The Debt-snowball method is a budgeting approach that addresses debt systematically.\n\n\n== Criticism ==\nGlobal criticism of credit counseling comes primarily from predatory practices that take advantage of debtors that are already struggling. These practices include failing to meet required standards, charging unlawful or unreasonable fees, failing to provide affordable solutions for consumers, and neglecting to make customers aware of free debt services available elsewhere.\n\n\n== Regulations by country ==\n\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, Credit counseling agencies are loosely regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation\u2019s consumer protection agency, which can sue companies that have deceived consumers about the cost, nature, or benefits of their services. Different states may regulate DMPs individually and Attorneys General are empowered to protect state citizens from fraud. Two professional associations represent Credit counselors: the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and the Association of Independent Consumer Credit Counseling Agencies.\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority is responsible for the regulation of consumer credit and has established a Debt Management Plan Protocol. It can impose fines for improper conduct.\n\n\n=== European Union ===\nElsewhere in the European Union, regulation and non-regulation of Credit counseling agencies and their approaches, including DMPs, are widely varied. In Sweden, guidelines for credit counseling are loosely provided by the Swedish Confederation of Professional Employees (TCO) and creditors are encouraged to use them in lieu of the court system. In Ireland, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) provides debt resolution information directly to debtors. In Latvia, a debt advisory company called LAKRA works with employers to assist indebted employees.\n\n\n=== Canada ===\nThe Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) advises Canadians to do their research and find a trustworthy organization and a qualified counselor. They suggest making sure an agency is in good standing with a provincial or national association. They recommend looking carefully at the agency's advertising to see if it sounds too good to be true. Claims or misrepresentations to look out for can include repaying only a fraction of your debt, quickly fixing your credit score, or claiming to be part of a government program. They also suggest consumers inquire about an agency's services, costs, and counselor qualifications. The FCAC has also warns Canadians to be careful of companies offering to help them pay off their debt or repair their credit. Things to watch out for include guarantees to solve debt problems and using high interest loans to pay off debt. Some of these companies also claim that they can file a consumer proposal on behalf of a consumer. However, the FCAC points out that only a qualified licensed insolvency trustee can help someone with a consumer proposal or bankruptcy.\n\n\n=== South Africa ===\nThe National Credit Regulator (NCR) was established as the regulator under the National Credit Act No. 34 of 2005 (The Act) and is responsible for the regulation of the South African credit industry. It is tasked with carrying out education, research, policy development, registration of industry participants, investigation of complaints, and ensuring the enforcement of the Act. The NCR is also tasked with the registration of credit providers, credit bureau and debt counselors; and with the enforcement of compliance with the Act. Debt Counselling was introduced and enforced in 2007. This enabled over-indebted consumers to seek relief in accordance to the National Credit Act (NCA). The NCA has been amended several times since inception and various new regulations published.\n\n\n== See also ==\nNational Foundation for Debt Management\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\nDebt Settlement Advice from US Federal Trade Commission\nNational Foundation for Credit Counseling"}

This was predicated upon the concerns over the rising population ageing rates and current methods of public payment for health either through taxes or insurance since such pay-as-you-go financing systems result in higher annual taxes or premiums. Such systems are unsustainable against rapid population ageing and a future shrinking bases of the young.\nRecently, these medical savings are used to pay for health care financing due to the exigencies of emergency spending due to the pandemic, and thus to avoid deficit funding by the government (Reference: COVID-19 poses challenges in healthcare financing, Straits Times, May 27, 2020).\n\n\n== United States ==\n\nThe United States has two medical savings account programs:\nMedical savings account (started 1993, still prevalent in California)\nHealth savings account (created 2003, supersedes MSAs, more widely available)\n\n\n== See also ==\nHealth care system\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== External links ==\n\"Health Savings Plans: Protecting Your Savings\".

{"title": "Credit analysis", "text": "Credit analysis is the method by which one calculates the creditworthiness of a business or organization. In other words, It is the evaluation of the ability of a company to honor its financial obligations. The audited financial statements of a large company might be analyzed when it issues or has issued bonds. Or, a bank may analyze the financial statements of a small business before making or renewing a commercial loan. The term refers to either case, whether the business is large or small. \nA credit analyst is the finance professional undertaking this role.\n\n\n== Role ==\n\nOne objective of credit analysis is to look at both the borrower and the lending facility being proposed and to assign a risk rating. The risk rating is derived by estimating the probability of default by the borrower at a given confidence level over the life of the facility, and by estimating the amount of loss that the lender would suffer in the event of default.\nCredit analysis involves a wide variety of financial analysis techniques, including ratio and trend analysis as well as the creation of projections and a detailed analysis of cash flows. \nCredit analysis also includes an examination of collateral and other sources of repayment as well as credit history and management ability. \nAs mentioned, analysts attempt to predict the probability that a borrower will default on its debts, and also the severity of losses in the event of default. \nThe credit spread is the difference in interest rates between theoretically \"risk-free\" investments such as U.S. treasuries or LIBOR and investments that carry some risk of default\u2014reflect credit analysis by financial market participants.\nBefore approving a commercial loan, a bank will look at all of these factors with the primary emphasis being the cash flow of the borrower. A typical measurement of repayment ability is the debt service coverage ratio or DSCR. \nA credit analyst at a bank will measure the cash generated by a business (before interest expense and excluding depreciation and any other non-cash or extraordinary expenses). \nThe DSCR divides this cash flow amount by the debt service (both principal and interest payments on all loans) that will be required to be met. Commercial bankers prefer a DSCR of at least 120 percent. In other words, the debt service coverage ratio should be 1.2 or higher to show that an extra cushion exists and that the business can afford its debt requirements.\n\n\n== Classic credit analysis ==\nTraditionally most banks have relied on subjective judgment to assess the credit risk of a corporate borrower. Essentially, bankers used information on various borrower characteristics \u2013 such as character (reputation), capital (leverage), capacity to pay (volatility of earnings), conditions of the customer's business (purpose of the loan), and collateral \u2013 in deciding whether or not to make a given loan. These characteristics are commonly referred to as the 5 Cs. Developing this type of expert system is time-consuming and expensive. Incorporating certain soft (qualitative) data in a risk model is particularly demanding, however successful implementation eliminates human error and reduces potential for misuse.   That is why, from time to time, banks have tried to clone their decision-making process. Even so, in the granting of credit to corporate customers, many banks continue to rely primarily on their traditional expert system for evaluating potential borrowers.\n\n\n== Credit scoring systems ==\nIn recent decades, a number of objective, quantitative systems for scoring credits have been developed. In univariate (one variable) accounting-based credit-scoring systems, the credit analyst compares various key accounting ratios of potential borrowers with industry or group norms and trends in these variables.\nToday, Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and Risk Management Association can all provide banks with industry ratios. The univariate approach enables an analyst starting an inquiry to determine whether a particular ratio for a potential borrower differs markedly from the norm for its industry. In reality, however, the unsatisfactory level of one ratio is frequently mitigated by the strength of some other measure. A firm, for example, may have a poor profitability ratio but an above-average liquidity ratio. One limitation of the univariate approach is the difficulty of making trade-offs between such weak and strong ratios. Of course, a good credit analyst can make these adjustments. However, some univariate measures \u2013 such as the specific industry group, public versus private company, and region \u2013 are categorical rather than ratio-level values. It is more difficult to make judgments about variables of this type.\nAlthough univariate models are still in use today in many banks, most academics and an increasing number of practitioners seem to disapprove of ratio analysis as a means of assessing the performance of a business enterprise. Many respected theorists downgrade the arbitrary rules of thumb (such as company ratio comparisons) that are widely used by practitioners and favor instead the application of more rigorous statistical techniques.\nFuzzy logic and neural networks are examples of novel methods of developing credit scoring expert systems that deliver greater accuracy in estimates of future performance of a business enterprise. Beside hard data present in traditional ratio analysis, fuzzy logic can easily incorporate linguistic terms and expert opinions which makes it more adapted to cases with insufficient and imprecise hard data, as well as for modeling risks that are not fully understood.\n\n\n== Education and training ==\n\nTypical education credentials often require a business related bachelor's degree majoring in finance, business, statistics, or accounting (to include an emphasis in finance or economics). \nAn MBA is not required, however is increasingly being held or pursued by analysts, often to become more competitive for advancement opportunities. \nCommercial bankers also undergo intense credit training provided by their bank or a third-party company.\n\n\n== References =="}
{"title": "Basis risk", "text": "Basis risk in finance is the risk associated with imperfect hedging due to the variables or characteristics that affect the difference between the futures contract and the underlying \"cash\" position. It arises because of the difference between the price of the asset to be hedged and the price of the asset serving as the hedge before expiration, namely b = S - F. Barring idiosyncratic influence by the other aspects to be enumerated just below, by the time of expiration this simple difference will be eliminated by arbitrage. The other aspects that give rise to basis risk include\n(a) Quality (grade) arising when the hedge in place has a different grade which is not perfectly correlated with the basis;\n(b) Timing arising due to mismatch between the expiration date of the hedge asset and the actual selling date of the underlying asset;\n(c) Location (leading to Transportation Costs) arising due to the difference in the location of the asset being hedged and the asset serving as the hedge, and which typically includes a premium to cover the risk these transportation costs may rise, causing a negative impact on the hedger.\n\n\n== Definition ==\nUnder these conditions, the spot price of the asset and the futures price do not converge on the expiration date of the future. The amount by which the two quantities differ measures the value of the basis risk. That is,\nBasis = Futures price of contract \u2212 Spot price of hedged asset.\nBasis risk is not to be confused with another type of risk known as price risk.\n\n\n== Examples ==\nSome examples of basis risks are: \n\nTreasury bill future being hedged by two year Bond, there lies the risk of not fluctuating as desired.\nForeign currency exchange rate (FX) hedge using a non-deliverable forward contract (NDF): the NDF fixing might vary substantially from the actual available spot rate on the market on fixing date.\nOver-the-counter (OTC) derivatives can help minimize basis risk by creating a perfect hedge. This is because OTC derivatives can be tailored to fit the exact risk needs of a hedger.\n\n\n== See also ==\nFinancial risk\nFinancial risk management\nList of finance topics\nUncertainty\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n=== Notes ===\n\n\n=== External links ===\nUnderstanding Derivatives: Markets and Infrastructure - Chapter 3, Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Financial Markets Group"}
{"title": "Hedge accounting", "text": "Hedge accounting is an accountancy practice, the aim of which is to provide an offset to the mark-to-market movement of the derivative in the profit and loss account.  \n\n\n== Types ==\nThere are two types of hedge recognized. For a fair value hedge, the offset is achieved either by marking-to-market an asset or a liability which offsets the P&L movement of the derivative.  For a cash flow hedge, some of the derivative volatility is placed into a separate component of the entity's equity called the cash flow hedge reserve. \nWhere a hedge relationship is effective (meets the 80%\u2013125% rule), most of the mark-to-market derivative volatility will be offset in the profit and loss account.  Hedge accounting entails much compliance - involving documenting the hedge relationship and both prospectively and retrospectively proving that the hedge relationship is  effective.\n\n\n== Necessity ==\nAll entities are exposed to some form of market risk. For example, gold mines are exposed to the price of gold, airlines to the price of jet fuel, borrowers to interest rates, and importers and exporters to exchange\nrate risks.\nMany financial institutions and corporate businesses (entities) use derivative financial instruments to hedge their exposure to different risks (for example interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk, etc.).\nAccounting for derivative financial instruments under International Accounting Standards is covered by IAS39 (Financial Instrument: Recognition and Measurement).IAS39 requires that all derivatives are marked-to-market with changes in the mark-to-market being taken to the profit and loss account.  For many entities this would result in a significant amount of profit and loss volatility arising from the use of derivatives.\nAn entity can mitigate the profit and loss effect arising from derivatives used for hedging, through an optional part of IAS39 relating to hedge accounting.\n\n\n== Foreign currency exposure ==\n\nA specific type of hedging transaction that entities can engage in aims to manage foreign currency exposure.  These hedges are undertaken for the economic aim of reducing potential loss from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. However, not all hedges are designated for special accounting treatment. Accounting standards enable hedge accounting for three different designated forex hedges: \n\nA cash flow hedge may be designated for a highly probable forecasted transaction, a firm commitment (not recorded on the balance sheet), foreign currency cash flows of a recognized asset or liability, or a forecasted intercompany transaction.\nA fair value hedge may be designated for a firm commitment (not recorded) or foreign currency cash flows of a recognized asset or liability.\nA net investment hedge may be designated for the net investment in a foreign operation.\n\n\n== See also ==\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments (replacement of IAS 39), of the International Accounting Standards Board\nIAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, of the International Accounting Standards Board\nFair value accounting\n\n\n== References ==\n\n\n== Sources ==\nA summary of the IAS39 by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.\n\n\n== External links ==\nIAS 39 summary as provided by Deloitte's IAS Plus website\nBasic Fixed Income Derivative Hedging - Article on Financial-edu.com.\nHedge Accounting Journal Entries\n[1] Comparing Hedge Accounting Under GAAP and IFRS 9\nRichard Steiman CPA"}

capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale business- es ( ib , cb , tss and am ) and consumer businesses ( rfs and cs ) . credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and declines in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained . the capital methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation . credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon product and other relevant risk segmentation . actual segment level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . statistical results for certain segments or portfolios are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench- marks , such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital held at representative monoline competitors , where appropriate . market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari- ables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , securities prices and commodities prices . daily value-at-risk ( 201cvar 201d ) , biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine appropriate capital levels . the firm allocates market risk capital to each business segment according to a formula that weights that seg- ment 2019s var and stress-test exposures . see market risk management on pages 111 2013116 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures . operational risk capital capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera- tional risk on a bottom-up basis . the operational risk capital model is based upon actual losses and potential scenario-based stress losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment or the use of risk-transfer prod- ucts . the firm believes its model is consistent with the new basel ii framework . private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately and publicly held securities , third-party fund investments and commitments in the private equity portfolio to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations . in addition to negative market fluctua- tions , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk . the capital allocation for the private equity portfolio is based upon measurement of the loss experience suffered by the firm and other market participants over a prolonged period of adverse equity market conditions . regulatory capital the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( the 201cfederal reserve 201d ) establishes capital requirements , including well-capitalized standards for the consolidated financial holding company . the office of the comptroller of the currency (

annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value . events that could indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include , but are not limited to , current economic and market conditions , including a decline in market capitalization , a significant adverse change in legal factors , business climate , operational performance of the business or key personnel , and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator . in performing the impairment test , the company utilizes the two-step approach prescribed under asc 350 . the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of each reporting unit to its estimated fair value . to estimate the fair value of its reporting units for step 1 , the company primarily utilizes the income approach . the income approach is based on a dcf analysis and calculates the fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting the after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate . assumptions used in the dcf require significant judgment , including judgment about appropriate discount rates and terminal values , growth rates , and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows . the forecasted cash flows are based on the company 2019s most recent budget and strategic plan and for years beyond this period , the company 2019s estimates are based on assumed growth rates expected as of the measurement date . the company believes its assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses . the discount rates used are intended to reflect the risks inherent in future cash flow projections and are based on estimates of the weighted-average cost of capital ( 201cwacc 201d ) of market participants relative to each respective reporting unit . the market approach considers comparable market data based on multiples of revenue or earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization ( 201cebitda 201d ) and is primarily used as a corroborative analysis to the results of the dcf analysis . the company believes its assumptions used to determine the fair value of its reporting units are reasonable . if different assumptions were used , particularly with respect to forecasted cash flows , terminal values , waccs , or market multiples , different estimates of fair value may result and there could be the potential that an impairment charge could result . actual operating results and the related cash flows of the reporting units could differ from the estimated operating results and related cash flows . if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value , the company is required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss , if any . the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit 2019s goodwill to its carrying value . the implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for each reporting unit as of the measurement date and allocating the reporting unit 2019s estimated fair value to its assets and liabilities . the residual amount from performing this allocation represents the implied fair value of goodwill . to the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill , an impairment charge is recorded . the company conducted its fiscal 2015 impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter , and as noted above used dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as of june 28 , 2015 , and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf approach in making its impairment test conclusions . the company believes it used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue , cost projections , cash flows , market multiples and discount rates as of the measurement date . as a result of completing step 1 , all of the company's reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values , and as such , step 2 of the impairment test was not required . for illustrative purposes , had the fair value of each of the reporting units that passed step 1 been lower than 10% ( 10 % ) , all of the reporting units would still have passed step 1 of the goodwill impairment test . at september 26 , 2015 , the company believes that each reporting unit , with goodwill aggregating 2.81 billion , was not at risk of failing step 1 of the goodwill impairment test based on the current forecasts . the company conducted its fiscal 2014 annual impairment test on the first day of the fourth quarter , and as noted above used dcf and market approaches to estimate the fair value of its reporting units as of june 29 , 2014 , and ultimately used the fair value determined by the dcf approach in making its impairment test conclusions . the company believes it used reasonable estimates and assumptions about future revenue , cost projections , cash flows , market multiples and discount rates as source

decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , aes sul and eletropaulo . the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016 . in december 2016 , eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to , among other things , provide more liquidity of its shares . aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business , including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016 . we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul . prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter , the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell . however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group . on october 31 , 2016 , the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $ 484 million , excluding contingent consideration . upon disposal of aes sul , we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $ 737 million . the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $ 1.1 billion . this includes the reclassification of approximately $ 1 billion of cumulative translation losses , resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $ 92 million . sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for

increased their ownership from 25% ( 25 % ) to 49.9% ( 49.9 % ) and made capital contributions of $ 106 million . any subsequent adjustments to allocate earnings and dividends to our partner , or measure the investment at fair value , will be classified as temporary equity each reporting period as it is probable that the shares will become redeemable . ipl 2014 ipl had $ 60 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , which represented five series of preferred stock . the total annual dividend requirements were approximately $ 3 million at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 . certain series of the preferred stock were redeemable solely at the option of the issuer at prices between $ 100 and $ 118 per share . holders of the preferred stock are entitled to elect a majority of ipl's board of directors if ipl has not paid dividends to its preferred stockholders for four consecutive quarters . based on the preferred stockholders' ability to elect a majority of ipl's board of directors in this circumstance , the redemption of the preferred shares is considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock is considered temporary equity . dpl 2014 dpl had $ 18 million of cumulative preferred stock outstanding as of december 31 , 2015 , which represented three series of preferred stock issued by dp&l , a wholly-owned subsidiary of dpl . the dp&l preferred stock was redeemable at dp&l's option as determined by its board of directors at per-share redemption prices between $ 101 and $ 103 per share , plus cumulative preferred dividends . in addition , dp&l's amended articles of incorporation contained provisions that permitted preferred stockholders to elect members of the dp&l board of directors in the event that cumulative dividends on the preferred stock are in arrears in an aggregate amount equivalent to at least four full quarterly dividends . based on the preferred stockholders' ability to elect members of dp&l's board of directors in this circumstance , the redemption of the preferred shares was considered to be not solely within the control of the issuer and the preferred stock was considered temporary equity . in september 2016 , it became probable that the preferred shares would become redeemable . as such , the company recorded an adjustment of $ 5 million to retained earnings to adjust the preferred shares to their redemption value of $ 23 million . in october 2016 , dp&l redeemed all of its preferred shares . upon redemption , the preferred shares were no longer outstanding and all rights of the holders thereof as shareholders of dp&l ceased to exist . ipalco 2014 in february 2015 , cdpq purchased 15% ( 15 % ) of aes us investment , inc. , a wholly-owned

april 2015 , cdpq invested an additional $ 214 million in ipalco , which resulted in cdpq's combined direct and indirect interest in ipalco of 24.90% ( 24.90 % ) . as a result of these transactions , $ 84 million in taxes and transaction costs were recognized as a net decrease to equity . the company also recognized an increase to additional paid-in capital and a reduction to retained earnings of 377 million for the excess of the fair value of the shares over their book value . no gain or loss was recognized in net income as the transaction was not considered to be a sale of in-substance real

, 2010 . net revenues , which include excise taxes billed to customers , decreased $ 221 million ( 1.0% ( 1.0 % ) ) due to lower shipment volume ( $ 1051 million ) , partially offset by higher net

will be higher due to more shipping days , but expected softer demand should cause the ship- ments per day to decrease . average sales price real- izations are expected to be comparable to fourth- quarter averages . an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter . costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase . manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills . euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs . consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix . consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 . operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels . compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix (

folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products . in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 . average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board . operating profits were 51% ( 51 % ) higher in 2006 than in 2005 , and 7% ( 7 % ) better than in 2004 . the impact of the higher sales prices along with more favorable manufacturing operations due to strong performance at the mills more than offset higher input costs for energy and freight . foodservice net sales declined to $ 396 million in 2006 , compared with $ 437 million in 2005 and $ 480 million in 2004 , due principally to the sale of the jackson , tennessee plant in july 2005 . sales vol- umes were lower in 2006 than in 2005 , although average sales prices were higher due to the realiza- tion of price increases implemented during 2005 . operating profits for 2006 improved over 2005 and 2004 levels largely due to the benefits from higher sales prices . raw material costs for bleached board were higher than in 2005 , but manufacturing costs were more favorable due to increased productivity and reduced waste . shorewood net sales of $ 670 million were down from $ 691 million in 2005 and $ 687 million in 2004 . sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment . average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 . operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs . entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols . average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january . it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter . foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume .

freight . entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly . however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix . industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6% ( 6 % ) to $

2019s claims . further , the company 2019s obligations under these agreements for indemnification based on breach of representations and warranties are generally limited in terms of duration , typically not more than 24 months , and for amounts not in excess of the contract value , and in some instances the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers . title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction . the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial . 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years . 2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: .\n||2015|2014|\n|u.s . pension plans|4.30% ( 4.30 % )|3.95% ( 3.95 % )|\n|non-u.s . pension plans|1.68% ( 1.68 % )|1.92% ( 1.92 % )|\n|postretirement plans|4.45% ( 4.45 % )|4.20% ( 4.20 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s . and non- u.s . pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .\nQuestion: what is the percentage change in the weighted-average discount rate for u.s . pension plans from 2014 to 2015?\nAnswer:"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "0.08861"}]}

substances at large commercial landfills that received waste from many different sources . while joint and several liability is authorized under cercla and equivalent state laws , as a practical matter , liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties . remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become probable and reasonably estimable . international paper has estimated the probable liability associated with these matters to be approximately $ 92 million in the aggregate at december 31 , 2012 . one of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake , minneso- ta . during 2009 , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla , international paper submitted to the epa a site remediation feasi- bility study . in june 2011 , the epa selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of $ 46 million . the overall remediation reserve for the site is currently $ 48 mil- lion to address this selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy deci- sion would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean-up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and sig- nificantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to per- form a natural resource damage assessment . it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred . in addition to the above matters , other remediation costs typically associated with the cleanup of

( 3.9 % )|\n( a ) effective in 2016 , the company began to measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows , as we believe this provides a better measurement of these costs . the company has accounted for this as a change in accounting estimate and , accordingly has accounted for it on a prospective basis . this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation . 2016 vs . 2015 pension expense , excluding special items , decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost , the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains , partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans . special items of $ 7.3 included pension settlement losses of $ 6.4 , special termination benefits of $ 2.0 , and curtailment gains of $ 1.1 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2015 vs . 2014 the decrease in pension expense , excluding special items , was due to the impact from expected return on assets , a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption , and lower service cost and interest cost . the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses , which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate . special items of $ 35.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 21.2 , special termination benefits of $ 8.7 , and curtailment losses of $ 5.3 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2017 outlook in 2017 , pension expense , excluding special items , is estimated to be approximately $ 70 to $ 75 , an increase of $ 10 to $ 15 from 2016 , resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates , offset by favorable asset experience , effects of the versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables . pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 15 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements . in 2017 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 164 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $ 121 in 2016 . net actuarial losses of $ 484 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016 , primarily attributable to lower discount rates and improved mortality projections . actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses . future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets different from expected returns would impact the actuarial gains/losses and resulting amortization in years beyond 2017 . during the first quarter of 2017 , the company expects to record a curtailment loss estimated to be $ 5 to $ 10 related to employees transferring to versum . the loss will be reflected in the results from discontinued operations on the consolidated income statements . we continue to evaluate opportunities to manage the liabilities associated with our pension plans . pension funding pension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans , which are primarily non-qualified plans . with respect to funded plans , our funding policy is that contributions , combined with appreciation and earnings , will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses . in addition , we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions . with the assistance of third party actuaries , we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan , which help guide the level of contributions . during 2016 and 2015 , our cash contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans were $ 79.3 and $ 137.5 , respectively . for 2017 , cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $ 65 to $ 85 . the estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international

appropriately accrued for our uncertain tax benefits . however , audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax

in any given future period could therefore be materially impacted . 22 . discontinued operations brazil distribution 2014 due to a portfolio evaluation in the first half of 2016 , management has decided to pursue a strategic shift of its distribution companies in brazil , aes sul and eletropaulo . the disposal of sul was completed in october 2016 . in december 2016 , eletropaulo underwent a corporate restructuring which is expected to , among other things , provide more liquidity of its shares . aes is continuing to pursue strategic options for eletropaulo in order to complete its strategic shift to reduce aes 2019 exposure to the brazilian distribution business , including preparation for listing its shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . the company executed an agreement for the sale of its wholly-owned subsidiary aes sul in june 2016 . we have reported the results of operations and financial position of aes sul as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented . upon meeting the held-for-sale criteria , the company recognized an after tax loss of $ 382 million comprised of a pretax impairment charge of $ 783 million , offset by a tax benefit of $ 266 million related to the impairment of the sul long lived assets and a tax benefit of $ 135 million for deferred taxes related to the investment in aes sul . prior to the impairment charge in the second quarter , the carrying value of the aes sul asset group of $ 1.6 billion was greater than its approximate fair value less costs to sell . however , the impairment charge was limited to the carrying value of the long lived assets of the aes sul disposal group . on october 31 , 2016 , the company completed the sale of aes sul and received final proceeds less costs to sell of $ 484 million , excluding contingent consideration . upon disposal of aes sul , we incurred an additional after- tax loss on sale of $ 737 million . the cumulative impact to earnings of the impairment and loss on sale was $ 1.1 billion . this includes the reclassification of approximately $ 1 billion of cumulative translation losses , resulting in a net reduction to the company 2019s stockholders 2019 equity of $ 92 million . sul 2019s pretax loss attributable to aes for

inquiries . the company and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as defendants in various legal actions , including arbitrations and other litigation arising in connection with blackrock 2019s activities . additionally , certain blackrock- sponsored investment funds that the company manages are subject to lawsuits , any of which potentially could harm the investment returns of the applicable fund or result in the company being liable to the funds for any resulting damages . management , after consultation with legal counsel , currently does not anticipate that the aggregate liability , if any , arising out of regulatory matters or lawsuits will have a material effect on blackrock 2019s results of operations , financial position , or cash flows . however , there is no assurance as to whether any such pending or threatened matters will have a material effect on blackrock 2019s results of operations , financial position or cash flows in any future reporting period .

ordinary course of business or in connection with certain acquisition agreements , blackrock enters into contracts pursuant to which it may agree to indemnify third parties in certain circumstances . the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability , if any , cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote .

a decline in unit sales of power macintosh systems . japan 2019s imac unit sales increased 85% ( 85 % ) in 2002 . however , in the case of japan the increase in imac unit shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the company in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above . additionally , net sales in japan on a sequential and year-over-year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions in japan . retail the company opened 25 new retail stores during 2003 , bringing the total number of open stores to 65 as of september 27 , 2003 , which compares to 40 open stores as of september 28 , 2002 and 8 open stores as of september 29 , 2001 . during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 , the company opened 9 additional stores including its first international store in the ginza in tokyo , japan . the retail segment 2019s net sales grew to $ 621 million during 2003 from $ 283 million in 2002 and from $ 19 million in 2001 . the $ 338 million or 119% ( 119 % ) increase in net sales during 2003 reflects the impact from opening 25 new stores in 2003 , the full year impact of 2002 store openings , as well as an increase in average revenue per store . total macintosh sales increased by approximately $ 170 million of which $ 108 million related to year-over-year increases in powerbook sales . the retail segment has also contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals , software and services experienced by the company during 2003 . during 2003 , approximately 45% ( 45 % ) of the retail segment 2019s net sales came from the sale of apple-branded and third-party peripherals , software and services as compared to 28% ( 28 % ) for the company as a whole . with an average of 54 stores open during 2003 , the retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $ 11.5 million , as compared to approximately $ 10.2 million based on an average of 28 stores open in 2002 . as measured by the company 2019s operating segment reporting , the retail segment improved from a loss of $ 22 million during 2002 to a loss of $ 5 million during 2003 . this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment 2019s year-over-year increase in net sales , which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy , depreciation and other fixed costs . expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure , operating lease commitments , personnel , and other operating expenses . capital expenditures associated with the retail segment since its inception totaled approximately $ 290 million through the end of fiscal 2003 , $ 92 million of which was incurred during 2003 . as of september 27 , 2003 , the retail segment had approximately 1300 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $ 354 million . the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores . such costs could adversely affect the company 2019s results of operations and financial condition . investment in a new business model such as the retail segment is inherently risky , particularly in light of the significant investment involved , the current economic climate , and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the retail segment 2019s operating expenses . gross margin gross margin for the three fiscal years ended

1603|$ 1235|\n|gross margin percentage|27.5% ( 27.5 % )|27.9% ( 27.9 % )|23.0% ( 23.0 % )|\ngross margin decreased to 27.5% ( 27.5 % ) of net sales in 2003 from 27.9% ( 27.9 % ) of net sales in 2002 . this decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several macintosh models instituted by the company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry , lower sales of relatively higher margin power macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003 , and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new power mac g5 and 15-inch powerbook , both of which began shipping in volume during september 2003 . this decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed . the aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales . the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions , price competition in the personal computer industry , and potential increases in component pricing . the company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the power mac g5 and other products during 2004 . the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin during 2004 , general demand for personal computers , anticipated industry component pricing , anticipated air freight charges , and future economic conditions are forward-looking . there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained

quarter averages . an additional containerboard price increase was announced in january that is expected to be fully realized in the second quarter . costs for wood , energy , starch , adhesives and freight are expected to increase . manufacturing costs will be higher due to costs associated with scheduled main- tenance outages in the containerboard mills . euro- pean container operating results are expected to improve as seasonally higher sales volumes and improved margins more than offset slightly higher manufacturing costs . consumer packaging demand and pricing for consumer packaging prod- ucts correlate closely with consumer spending and general economic activity . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of consumer packaging are raw material and energy costs , manufacturing efficiency and product mix . consumer packaging net sales increased 9% ( 9 % ) compared with 2005 and 7% ( 7 % ) compared with 2004 . operating profits rose 8% ( 8 % ) from 2005 , but declined 15% ( 15 % ) from 2004 levels . compared with 2005 , higher sales volumes ( $ 9 million ) , improved average sales price realizations ( $ 33 million ) , reduced lack-of-order downtime ( $ 18 million ) , and favorable mill oper- ations ( $ 25 million ) were partially offset by higher raw material costs ( $ 19 million ) and freight costs ( $ 21 million ) , unfavorable mix (

folding car- ton board segment , reflecting improved demand for coated paperboard products . in 2006 , our coated paperboard mills took 4000 tons of lack-of-order downtime , compared with 82000 tons of lack-of-order downtime in 2005 . average sales price realizations were substantially improved in the cur- rent year , principally for folding carton board and cupstock board . operating profits

million in 2004 . sales volumes in 2006 were down from 2005 levels due to weak demand in the home entertainment and consumer products markets , although demand was strong in the tobacco segment . average sales prices for the year were lower than in 2005 . operating prof- its were down significantly from both 2005 and 2004 due to the decline in sales , particularly in the higher margin home entertainment markets , higher raw material costs for bleached board and certain inventory adjustment costs . entering 2007 , coated paperboard first-quarter sales volumes are expected to be seasonally stronger than in the fourth quarter 2006 for folding carton board and bristols . average sales price realizations are expected to rise with a price increase announced in january . it is anticipated that manufacturing costs will improve versus an unfavorable fourth quarter . foodservice earnings for the first quarter of 2007 are expected to decline due to seasonally weaker vol- ume .

thereafter , respectively . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31

30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due . generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated . at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr . see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate . initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program . if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program . our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal . temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs . further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs . additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification . typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate . a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed . permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs . for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance . examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment . permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made . residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months . we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to

2001 , with a slight decline in unit sales of 2% ( 2 % ) . consistent with the company 2019s other geographic operating segments , during 2002 japan showed growth in unit sales of consumer systems and a decline in unit sales of power macintosh systems . japan 2019s imac unit sales increased 85% ( 85 % ) in 2002 . however , in the case of japan the increase in imac unit shipments in 2002 versus 2001 was primarily the result of the unusually depressed level of net sales experienced by the company in the first quarter of 2001 as discussed above . additionally , net sales in japan on a sequential and year-over-year comparative basis generally worsened as 2002 progressed reflecting particularly poor economic conditions in japan . retail the company opened 25 new retail stores during 2003 , bringing the total number of open stores to 65 as of september 27 , 2003 , which compares to 40 open stores as of september 28 , 2002 and 8 open stores as of september 29 , 2001 . during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 , the company opened 9 additional stores including its first international store in the ginza in tokyo , japan . the retail segment 2019s net sales grew to $ 621 million during 2003 from $ 283 million in 2002 and from $ 19 million in 2001 . the $ 338 million or 119% ( 119 % ) increase in net sales during 2003 reflects the impact from opening 25 new stores in 2003 , the full year impact of 2002 store openings , as well as an increase in average revenue per store . total macintosh sales increased by approximately $ 170 million of which $ 108 million related to year-over-year increases in powerbook sales . the retail segment has also contributed strongly to the increases in net sales of peripherals , software and services experienced by the company during 2003 . during 2003 , approximately 45% ( 45 % ) of the retail segment 2019s net sales came from the sale of apple-branded and third-party peripherals , software and services as compared to 28% ( 28 % ) for the company as a whole . with an average of 54 stores open during 2003 , the retail segment achieved annualized revenue per store of approximately $ 11.5 million , as compared to approximately $ 10.2 million based on an average of 28 stores open in 2002 . as measured by the company 2019s operating segment reporting , the retail segment improved from a loss of $ 22 million during 2002 to a loss of $ 5 million during 2003 . this improvement is primarily attributable to the segment 2019s year-over-year increase in net sales , which resulted in higher leverage on occupancy , depreciation and other fixed costs . expansion of the retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure , operating lease commitments , personnel , and other operating expenses . capital expenditures associated with the retail segment since its inception totaled approximately $ 290 million through the end of fiscal 2003 , $ 92 million of which was incurred during 2003 . as of september 27 , 2003 , the retail segment had approximately 1300 employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $ 354 million . the company would incur substantial costs should it choose to terminate its retail segment or close individual stores . such costs could adversely affect the company 2019s results of operations and financial condition . investment in a new business model such as the retail segment is inherently risky , particularly in light of the significant investment involved , the current economic climate , and the fixed nature of a substantial portion of the retail segment 2019s operating expenses . gross margin gross margin for the three fiscal years ended

this decline in gross margin reflects relatively aggressive pricing actions on several macintosh models instituted by the company beginning in late fiscal 2002 as a result of continued pricing pressure throughout the personal computer industry , lower sales of relatively higher margin power macintosh systems during the first three fiscal quarters of 2003 , and increased air freight and manufacturing costs associated with the production ramp-up of the new power mac g5 and 15-inch powerbook , both of which began shipping in volume during september 2003 . this decline is also attributable to a rise in certain component costs as the year progressed . the aforementioned negative factors affecting gross margins during 2003 were partially offset by the increase in higher margin software and direct sales . the company anticipates that its gross margin and the gross margin of the overall personal computer industry will remain under pressure throughout fiscal 2004 in light of weak economic conditions , price competition in the personal computer industry , and potential increases in component pricing . the company also expects to continue to incur air freight charges on the power mac g5 and other products during 2004 . the foregoing statements regarding the company 2019s expected gross margin during 2004 , general demand for personal computers , anticipated industry component pricing , anticipated air freight charges , and future economic conditions are forward-looking . there can be no assurance that current gross margins will be maintained

we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists , delivery of product has occurred , the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured . for our company , this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers . title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer's location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction . the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience , and these estimates are normally immaterial . 2022 goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2015 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.4 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2015 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non-amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value , and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result in an impairment . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . 2022 marketing and advertising costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs which include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer achieving the specified targets and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to estimate our marketing programs during the past three years . 2022 employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans are as follows: .\n||2015|2014|\n|u.s . pension plans|4.30% ( 4.30 % )|3.95% ( 3.95 % )|\n|non-u.s . pension plans|1.68% ( 1.68 % )|1.92% ( 1.92 % )|\n|postretirement plans|4.45% ( 4.45 % )|4.20% ( 4.20 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes , coupled with decreased amortization of deferred losses , will decrease 2016 pre-tax u.s . and non- u.s . pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 209 million as compared with approximately $ 240 million in 2015 , excluding .\nQuestion: what is the percentage change in the weighted-average discount rate for non-u.s . pension plans from 2014 to 2015?\nAnswer:"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "-0.125"}]}

stress testing the var and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of the firm 2019s consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables . the effect of interest rate exposure on reported net income is also important . interest rate risk exposure in the firm 2019s core nontrading business activities ( i.e. , asset/liability management positions ) results from on 2013and off 2013balance sheet positions and can occur due to a variety of factors , including : 2022 differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments . for example , if liabilities reprice quicker than assets and funding interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially . 2022 differences in the amounts of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments that are repricing at the same time . for example , if more deposit liabilities are repricing than assets when general interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially . 2022 differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change ( for example , changes in the slope of the yield curve , because the firm has the ability to lend at long-term fixed rates and borrow at variable or short- term fixed rates ) . based on these scenarios , the firm 2019s earnings would be affected negatively by a sudden and unanticipated increase in short-term rates paid on its liabilities ( e.g. , depos- its ) without a corresponding increase in long-term rates re- ceived on its assets ( e.g. , loans ) . conversely , higher long-term rates received on assets generally are beneficial to earnings , particularly when the increase is not accompanied by rising short-term rates paid on liabilities . 2022 the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets , liabili- ties or off 2013balance sheet instruments as interest rates change . for example , if more borrowers than forecasted pay down higher-rate loan balances when general interest rates are de- clining , earnings may decrease initially . the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated , corporate-wide basis . business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury through a transfer- pricing system , which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets . these elements include asset and liability balances and contrac- tual rates of interest , contractual principal payment schedules , expected prepayment experience , interest rate reset dates and maturities , rate indices used for repricing , and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products . all transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed . the firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income from its nontrading activities under a variety of interest rate scenarios . earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change in the firm 2019s net interest income , and the corresponding impact to the firm 2019s pretax earnings , over the following 12 months . these tests highlight exposures to various rate-sensitive factors , such as the rates themselves ( e.g. , the prime lending rate ) , pricing strate- gies on deposits , optionality and changes in product mix . the tests include forecasted balance sheet changes , such as asset sales and securitizations , as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior . immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk , and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed . these scenarios include the implied forward curve , nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates . these scenar- ios are intended to provide a comprehensive view of jpmorgan chase 2019s earnings at risk over a wide range of outcomes . jpmorgan chase 2019s 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profile as of december 31 , 2009 and 2008 , is as follows. .\n|( in millions )|immediate change in rates +200bp|immediate change in rates +100bp|immediate change in rates -100bp|immediate change in rates -200bp|\n|december 31 2009|$ -1594 ( 1594 )|$ -554 ( 554 )|nm ( a )|nm ( a )|\n|december 31 2008|$ 336|$ 672|nm ( a )|nm ( a )|\ndecember 31 , 2009 $ ( 1594 ) $ ( 554 ) nm ( a ) nm ( a )

earnings- at-risk results of such a low-probability scenario are not meaningful . the change in earnings at risk from december 31 , 2008 , results from a higher level of afs securities and an updated baseline scenario that uses higher short-term interest rates . the firm 2019s risk to rising rates is largely the result of increased funding costs on assets , partially offset by widening deposit margins , which are currently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates . additionally , another interest rate scenario , involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 100 basis points and short- term rates staying at current levels , results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of $ 449 million . the increase in earnings is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates , with funding costs remaining unchanged . risk identification for large exposures individuals who manage risk positions , particularly those that are complex , are responsible for identifying potential losses that could arise from specific , unusual events , such as a potential tax change , and estimating the probabilities of losses arising from such events . this information is entered into the firm 2019s rifle database . management of trading businesses control rifle entries , thereby permitting the firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not adequately covered by standard risk measures . risk monitoring and control limits market risk is controlled primarily through a series of limits . limits reflect the firm 2019s risk appetite in the context of the market environment and business strategy . in setting limits , the firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility , product liquidity , business trends and management experience. .\nQuestion: if there were a 100bp rise in rates , how much more would the impact be on earnings in 2009 vs . 2008?\\\\n\nAnswer:"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "1226.0"}]}

previously were required to be accounted for under the equity method . the company elected fair-value accounting to reduce operational and accounting complexity . since the funds account for all of their underlying assets at fair value , the impact of applying the equity method to citigroup 2019s investment in these funds was equivalent to fair-value accounting . thus , this fair-value election had no impact on opening retained earnings . these investments are classified as other assets on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . changes in the fair values of these investments are

whose performance is linked to structured interest rates , inflation or currency risks ( 201cstructured liabilities 201d ) . the company elected the fair- value option , because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis . these positions will continue to be classified as debt , deposits or derivatives ( trading account liabilities ) on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form . for those structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been

tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043 . the 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 500 million at a 2.25% ( 2.25 % ) fixed , annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 , 2023 . the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of $ 500 million at a 3.625% ( 3.625 % ) fixed , annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 , 2043 . interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year . the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of $ 998 million . on october 29 , 2015 , we issued an additional $ 1.0 billion of senior notes at a 3.875% ( 3.875 % ) fixed , annual interest rate that will mature on november 1 , 2045 . interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually on may 1 and november 1 of each year . the issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of $ 991 million . the shelf expired on april 23 , 2016 . we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec in july 2016 . on august 28 , 2015 , we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks , which provides for up to $ 2 billion of borrowings . the facility matures august 28 , 2020 , with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date , provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 , 2022 . this facility replaces the prior $ 1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on november 1 , 2011 , which would have matured november 1 , 2017 . as of and for the periods ended may 31 , 2016 and 2015 , we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility . we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . if our long- term debt ratings were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase . conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease . changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility . under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants . these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth . in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable . as of may 31 , 2016 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future . liquidity is also provided by our $ 2 billion commercial paper program , which increased $ 1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 . during the year ended may 31 , 2016 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2016 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program . any future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs . we currently have short-term debt ratings of a1+ and p1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . as of may 31 , 2016 , we had cash , cash equivalents and short-term investments totaling $ 5.5 billion , of which $ 4.6 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries . included in cash and equivalents as of may 31 , 2016 was $ 105 million of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity . cash equivalents and short-term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks , money market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s . treasury obligations , u.s . government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities . our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk . all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk . while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2016 , the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 91 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss , we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations . contractual obligations our significant long-term contractual obligations as of may 31 , 2016

thereafter , respectively . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31 , 2011 , for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw ( e.g. , draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated ) , approximately 4.32% ( 4.32 % ) were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due . generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated . at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr . see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate . initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program . if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program . our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal . temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs . further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs . additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification . typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate . a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed . permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs . for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance . examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment . permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made . residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months . we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses . the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer

also , current law , including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan . we do not expect to be required by law to make any contributions to the plan during 2012 . we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results , including various nonqualified supplemental retirement plans for certain employees . recourse and repurchase obligations as discussed in note 3 loan sale and servicing activities and variable interest entities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , pnc has sold commercial mortgage and residential mortgage loans directly or indirectly in securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions with continuing involvement . one form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets in these transactions . commercial mortgage loan recourse obligations we originate , close , and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to fnma under fnma 2019s delegated underwriting and servicing ( dus ) program . we participated in a similar program with the fhlmc . under these programs , we generally assume up to a one-third pari passu risk of loss on unpaid principal balances through a loss share arrangement . at december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold as a participant in these programs was $ 13.0 billion and $ 13.2 billion , respectively . the potential maximum exposure under the loss share arrangements was $ 4.0 billion at both december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 . we maintain a reserve for estimated losses based on our exposure . the reserve for losses under these programs totaled $ 47 million and $ 54 million as of december 31 , 2011 and december 31 , 2010 , respectively , and is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet . if payment is required under these programs , we would not have a contractual interest in the collateral underlying the mortgage loans on which losses occurred , although the value of the collateral is taken into account in determining our share of such losses . our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the corporate & institutional banking segment . residential mortgage loan and home equity repurchase obligations while residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis , we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors . these loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where pnc is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements . residential mortgage loans covered by these loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through agency securitizations , non-agency securitizations , and whole-loan sale transactions . as discussed in note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report , agency securitizations consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with fnma , fhlmc , and the government national mortgage association ( gnma ) program , while non-agency securitizations and whole-loan sale transactions consist of mortgage loans sale transactions with private investors . our historical exposure and activity associated with agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with fnma and fhlmc , as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with federal housing agency ( fha ) and department of veterans affairs ( va ) -insured and uninsured loans pooled in gnma securitizations historically have been minimal . repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the residential mortgage banking segment . pnc 2019s repurchase obligations also include certain brokered home equity loans/lines that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by national city prior to our acquisition . pnc is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business , and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the whole-loans sold in these transactions . repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity lines/loans are reported in the non-strategic assets portfolio segment . loan covenants and representations and warranties are established through loan sale agreements with various investors to provide assurance that pnc has

accounts of $ 147 million . partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower net income tax payments in 2009 as compared to 2008 in the amount of $ 319 million . the decline in cash provided by operating working capital primarily was due to growth of receivables on various programs in the ms2 and gt&l lines of business at electronic systems and an increase in inventories on combat aircraft programs at aeronautics , which partially were offset by increases in customer advances and amounts in excess of costs incurred on government satellite programs at space systems and the timing of accounts payable activities . investing activities capital expenditures 2013 the majority of our capital expenditures relate to facilities infrastructure and equipment that are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments . we also incur capital expenditures for it to support programs and general enterprise it infrastructure . capital expenditures

had no impact on opening retained earnings . these investments are classified as other assets on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . changes in the fair values of these investments are

to strengthen or weaken by 10% ( 10 % ) , we currently estimate operating income would decrease or increase approximately 4% ( 4 % ) , assuming that all currencies are impacted in the same manner and our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015 levels . the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency . assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date , and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented . the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss , net of tax , in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets . our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency , mitigating transaction risk . however , certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency . assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement . currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses . we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures . we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. .\nQuestion: what

financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper 2019s operating results in 2005 were strongly impacted by significantly higher costs for en- ergy , wood , caustic soda and other raw materials which reduced operating profits compared with 2004 by $ 586 million . lower sales volumes were also a negative factor versus 2004 as we took a significant amount of lack-of-order downtime in our u.s . uncoated paper and containerboard mills , and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in po- land and russia to add needed uncoated paper and pa- perboard capacity . we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations , im- proved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades , a more favorable product mix , and higher earn- ings from forestland and real estate sales . looking forward to 2006 , we expect operating prof- its for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter . sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter , but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses . price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are im- plemented . while energy , wood and raw material price movements are mixed , their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat . however , we see favorable signs of positive mo- mentum for the remainder of 2006 . we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger , and that we will realize 2005 fourth-quarter and 2006 first-quarter announced price increases . additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and container- board . we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that , if the trend continues , should benefit operations as the year pro- gresses . in connection with our overall strategic direction , we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spin-off of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan , with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 . we also will con- tinue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill oper- ations to reduce costs , improve our products and im- prove our overall profitability . results of operations industry segment operating profits are used by international paper 2019s management to measure the earn- ings performance of its businesses . management believes that this measure allows a better understanding of trends in costs , operating efficiencies , prices and volumes . in- dustry segment operating profits are defined as earnings before taxes and minority interest , interest expense , corporate items and corporate special items . industry segment operating profits are defined by the securities and exchange commission as a non-gaap financial measure , and are not gaap alternatives to net income or any other operating measure prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states . international paper operates in six segments : print- ing papers , industrial packaging , consumer packaging , distribution , forest products , and specialty businesses and other . the

( $ 586 million ) , lower sales volume ( $ 251 million ) , and unfavorable for- eign currency translation rates ( $ 27 million ) which more than offset the benefits from higher average prices ( $ 478

permitted practice relates to the statutory accounting for deferred income taxes . specifically , this permitted practice modifies the accounting for deferred income taxes prescribed by the naic by increasing the realization period for deferred tax assets from one year to three years and increasing the asset recognition limit from 10% ( 10 % ) to 15% ( 15 % ) of adjusted statutory capital and surplus . the benefits of this permitted practice may not be considered by the company when determining surplus available for dividends . the second permitted practice relates to the statutory reserving requirements for variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders . actuarial guidelines prescribed by the naic require a stand-alone asset adequacy analysis reflecting only benefits , expenses and charges that are associated with the riders for variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits . the permitted practice allows for all benefits , expenses and charges associated with the variable annuity contract to be reflected in the stand- alone asset adequacy test . these permitted practices resulted in an increase to life operations estimated statutory surplus of $ 987

capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale business- es ( ib , cb , tss and am ) and consumer businesses ( rfs and cs ) . credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and declines in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained . the capital methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation . credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon product and other relevant risk segmentation . actual segment level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . statistical results for certain segments or portfolios are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench- marks , such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital held at representative monoline competitors , where appropriate . market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari- ables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , securities prices and commodities prices . daily value-at-risk ( 201cvar 201d ) , biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine appropriate capital levels . the firm allocates market risk capital to each business segment according to a formula that weights that seg- ment 2019s var and stress-test exposures . see market risk management on pages 111 2013116 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures . operational risk capital capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera- tional risk on a bottom-up basis . the operational risk capital model is based upon actual losses and potential scenario-based stress losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment or the use of risk-transfer prod- ucts . the firm believes its model is consistent with the new basel ii framework . private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately and publicly held securities , third-party fund investments and commitments in the private equity portfolio to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations . in addition to negative market fluctua- tions , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk . the capital allocation for the private equity portfolio is based upon measurement of the loss experience suffered by the firm and other market participants over a prolonged period of adverse equity market conditions . regulatory capital the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( the 201cfederal reserve 201d ) establishes capital requirements , including well-capitalized standards for the consolidated financial holding company . the office of the comptroller of the currency (

71.4 billion was up $ 9.4 billion , or 15% ( 15 % ) , from the prior year . higher net interest income , very strong private equity gains , record asset management , administration and commissions revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth . these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue . investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 . record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees . for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report . principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains . trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments . also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities . equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products . ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities . the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) . for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report . lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction . for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report . asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 . increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results . the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services . tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody . finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities . for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 , rfs on pages 43 201348 , tss on pages 54 201355 , and am on pages 56 201358 , of this annual report . the favorable variance resulting from securities gains in 2007 compared with securities losses in 2006 was primarily driven by improvements in the results of repositioning of the treasury invest- ment securities portfolio . also contributing to the positive variance was a $ 234 million gain from the sale of mastercard shares . for a fur- ther discussion of securities gains ( losses ) , which

the terms of these indemnities vary from contract to contract and the amount of indemnification liability , if any , cannot be determined or the likelihood of any liability is considered remote .

increased during 2016 , contributing to net gains from investments in public equities , and corporate performance rebounded from the difficult start to the year . if macroeconomic concerns negatively affect corporate performance or company-specific events , or if global equity markets decline , net revenues in investing & lending would likely be negatively impacted . although net revenues in

primarily due to significantly lower net revenues from investments in equities , primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities , driven by company-specific events and corporate performance . in addition , net revenues in debt securities and loans were lower compared with 2015 , reflecting significantly lower net revenues related to relationship lending activities , due to the impact of changes in credit spreads on economic hedges . losses related to these hedges were $ 596 million in 2016 , compared with gains of $ 329 million in 2015 . this decrease was partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments and higher net interest income . see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about economic

allegedly resulting from contamination of groundwater by mtbe . we are vigorously defending these cases . we have engaged in settlement discussions related to the majority of these cases . we do not expect our share of liability for these cases to significantly impact our consolidated results of operations , financial position or cash flows . we voluntarily discontinued producing mtbe in 2002 .

real estate ventures for the purpose of earning investment returns and for capital appreciation . the company has elected the fair-value option for certain of these ventures , because such investments are considered similar to many private equity or hedge fund activities in our investment companies , which are reported at fair value . the fair-value option brings consistency in the accounting and evaluation of certain of these investments . as required by sfas 159 , all investments ( debt and equity ) in such private equity and real estate entities are accounted for at fair value . these investments are classified as investments on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . citigroup also holds various non-strategic investments in leveraged buyout funds and other hedge funds that previously were required to be accounted for under the equity method . the company elected fair-value accounting to reduce operational and accounting complexity . since the funds account for all of their underlying assets at fair value , the impact of applying the equity method to citigroup 2019s investment in these funds was equivalent to fair-value accounting . thus , this fair-value election had no impact on opening retained earnings . these investments are classified as other assets on citigroup 2019s consolidated balance sheet . changes in the fair values of these investments are classified in other revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . certain structured liabilities the company has elected the fair-value option for certain structured liabilities whose performance is linked to structured interest rates , inflation or currency risks ( 201cstructured liabilities 201d ) . the company elected the fair- value option , because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis . these positions will continue to be classified as debt , deposits or derivatives ( trading account liabilities ) on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form . for those structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 277 million as of december 31 , 2008 and $ 7 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the change in fair value for these structured liabilities is reported in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . related interest expense is measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . certain non-structured liabilities the company has elected the fair-value option for certain non-structured liabilities with

net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $ 3.06 billion for 2015 , 24% ( 24 % ) lower than 2014 . the decrease compared with 2014 was due to lower interest income resulting from a reduction in interest income related to financial instruments owned , at fair value , partially offset by the impact of an increase in total average loans receivable . the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense , which primarily reflected lower interest expense related to financial instruments sold , but not yet purchased , at fair value and other

future mortgage prepay- ments based upon a number of market related factors including a downward trend in home prices , general tightening of credit under- writing standards and the associated impact on refinancing activity . the firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience . the fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates , includ- ing their effect on prepayment speeds . jpmorgan chase uses or has used combinations of derivatives , afs securities and trading instru- ments to manage changes in the fair value of msrs . the intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of msrs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments . msrs decrease in value when interest rates decline . conversely , securities ( such as mort- gage-backed securities ) , principal-only certificates and certain deriva- tives ( when the firm receives fixed-rate interest payments ) increase in value when interest rates decline . in march 2006 , the fasb issued sfas 156 , which permits an entity a one-time irrevocable election to adopt fair value accounting for a class of servicing assets . jpmorgan chase elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 , 2006 , and defined msrs as one class of servicing assets for this election . at the transition date , the fair value of the msrs exceeded their carrying amount , net of any related valuation allowance , by $ 150 million net of taxes . this amount was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 , 2006 . msrs are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value , and changes in their fair value are recorded in current- period earnings . revenue amounts related to msrs and the financial instruments used to manage the risk of msrs are recorded in mortgage fees and related income . for the year ended december 31 , 2005 , msrs were accounted for under sfas 140 , using a lower of cost or fair value approach . under this approach , msrs were amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans . for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of msrs , the firm stratified the portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics , which are loan type and interest rate . any indicated impairment was rec- ognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation allowance , which represented the extent to which the carrying value of an individual stra- tum exceeded its estimated fair value . any gross carrying value and relat- ed valuation allowance amounts which were not expected to be recov- ered in the foreseeable future , based upon the interest rate scenario , were considered to be other-than-temporary . prior to the adoption of sfas 156 , the firm designated certain deriva- tives used to risk manage msrs ( e.g. , a combination of swaps , swap- tions and floors ) as sfas 133 fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk . sfas 133 hedge accounting allowed the carrying value of the hedged msrs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives was recognized through earnings . the designated hedge period was daily . in designat- ing the benchmark interest rate , the firm considered the impact that the change in the benchmark rate had on the prepayment speed esti- mates in determining the fair value of the msrs . hedge effectiveness was assessed using a regression analysis of the change in fair value of the msrs as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates and of the change in the fair value of the designated derivatives . the valua- tion adjustments to both the msrs and sfas 133 derivatives were recorded in mortgage fees and related income . with the election to apply fair value accounting to the msrs under sfas 156 , sfas 133 hedge accounting is no longer necessary . for a further discussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities , see note 30 on pages 168 2013169 of this annual report . the following table summarizes msr activity , certain key assumptions , and the sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to adverse changes in those key assumptions for

2019s discussion and analysis non-interest revenues . investment banking revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 7.03 billion for 2015 , 9% ( 9 % ) higher than 2014 , due to significantly higher revenues in financial advisory , reflecting strong client activity , particularly in the u.s . industry-wide completed mergers and acquisitions increased significantly compared with the prior year . revenues in underwriting were lower compared with a strong 2014 . revenues in debt underwriting were lower compared with 2014 , reflecting significantly lower leveraged finance activity . revenues in equity underwriting were also lower , reflecting significantly lower revenues from initial public offerings and convertible offerings , partially offset by significantly higher revenues from secondary offerings . investment management revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 5.87 billion for 2015 , 2% ( 2 % ) higher than 2014 , due to slightly higher management and other fees , primarily reflecting higher average assets under supervision , and higher transaction revenues . commissions and fees in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 3.32 billion for 2015 , essentially unchanged compared with 2014 . market-making revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 9.52 billion for 2015 , 14% ( 14 % ) higher than 2014 . excluding a gain of $ 289 million in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt , market-making revenues were 18% ( 18 % ) higher than 2014 , reflecting significantly higher revenues in interest rate products , currencies , equity cash products and equity derivatives . these increases were partially offset by significantly lower revenues in mortgages , commodities and credit products . other principal transactions revenues in the consolidated statements of earnings were $ 5.02 billion for 2015 , 24% ( 24 % ) lower than 2014 . this decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from investments in equities , principally reflecting the sale of metro international trade services ( metro ) in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net gains from investments in private equities , driven by corporate performance . in addition , revenues in debt securities and loans were significantly lower , reflecting lower net gains from investments . net interest income . net interest income in the consolidated statements of earnings was $ 3.06 billion for 2015 , 24% ( 24 % ) lower than 2014 . the decrease compared with 2014 was due to lower interest income resulting from a reduction in interest income related to financial instruments owned , at fair value , partially offset by the impact of an increase in total average loans receivable . the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a decrease in interest expense , which primarily reflected lower interest expense related to financial instruments sold , but not yet purchased , at fair value and other interest-bearing liabilities , partially offset by higher interest expense related to long-term borrowings . see 201csupplemental financial information 2014 statistical disclosures 2014 distribution

risk-adjusted rates . the model considers portfolio characteris- tics , contractually specified servicing fees , prepayment assumptions , delinquency rates , late charges , other ancillary revenue and costs to service , and other economic factors . the firm reassesses and periodi- cally adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions used in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market par- ticipant would consider in valuing the msr asset . during the fourth quarter of the 2007 , the firm 2019s proprietary prepayment model was refined to reflect a decrease in estimated future mortgage prepay- ments based upon a number of market related factors including a downward trend in home prices , general tightening of credit under- writing standards and the associated impact on refinancing activity . the firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and actual portfolio experience . the fair value of msrs is sensitive to changes in interest rates , includ- ing their effect on prepayment speeds . jpmorgan chase uses or has used combinations of derivatives , afs securities and trading instru- ments to manage changes in the fair value of msrs . the intent is to offset any changes in the fair value of msrs with changes in the fair value of the related risk management instruments . msrs decrease in value when interest rates decline . conversely , securities ( such as mort- gage-backed securities ) , principal-only certificates and certain deriva- tives ( when the firm receives fixed-rate interest payments ) increase in value when interest rates decline . in march 2006 , the fasb issued sfas 156 , which permits an entity a one-time irrevocable election to adopt fair value accounting for a class of servicing assets . jpmorgan chase elected to adopt the standard effective january 1 , 2006 , and defined msrs as one class of servicing assets for this election . at the transition date , the fair value of the msrs exceeded their carrying amount , net of any related valuation allowance , by $ 150 million net of taxes . this amount was recorded as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1 , 2006 . msrs are recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value , and changes in their fair value are recorded in current- period earnings . revenue amounts related to msrs and the financial instruments used to manage the risk of msrs are recorded in mortgage fees and related income . for the year ended december 31 , 2005 , msrs were accounted for under sfas 140 , using a lower of cost or fair value approach . under this approach , msrs were amortized as a reduction of the actual servicing income received in proportion to , and over the period of , the estimated future net servicing income stream of the underlying mortgage loans . for purposes of evaluating and measuring impairment of msrs , the firm stratified the portfolio on the basis of the predominant risk characteristics , which are loan type and interest rate . any indicated impairment was rec- ognized as a reduction in revenue through a valuation allowance , which represented the extent to which the carrying value of an individual stra- tum exceeded its estimated fair value . any gross carrying value and relat- ed valuation allowance amounts which were not expected to be recov- ered in the foreseeable future , based upon the interest rate scenario , were considered to be other-than-temporary . prior to the adoption of sfas 156 , the firm designated certain deriva- tives used to risk manage msrs ( e.g. , a combination of swaps , swap- tions and floors ) as sfas 133 fair value hedges of benchmark interest rate risk . sfas 133 hedge accounting allowed the carrying value of the hedged msrs to be adjusted through earnings in the same period that the change in value of the hedging derivatives was recognized through earnings . the designated hedge period was daily . in designat- ing the benchmark interest rate , the firm considered the impact that the change in the benchmark rate had on the prepayment speed esti- mates in determining the fair value of the msrs . hedge effectiveness was assessed using a regression analysis of the change in fair value of the msrs as a result of changes in benchmark interest rates and of the change in the fair value of the designated derivatives . the valua- tion adjustments to both the msrs and sfas 133 derivatives were recorded in mortgage fees and related income . with the election to apply fair value accounting to the msrs under sfas 156 , sfas 133 hedge accounting is no longer necessary . for a further discussion on derivative instruments and hedging activities , see note 30 on pages 168 2013169 of this annual report . the following table summarizes msr activity , certain key assumptions , and the sensitivity of the fair value of msrs to adverse changes in those key assumptions for

revenue , higher mortgage fees and related income and record investment banking fees contributed to the revenue growth . these increases were offset partially by lower trading revenue . investment banking fees grew in 2007 to a level higher than the pre- vious record set in 2006 . record advisory and equity underwriting fees drove the results , partially offset by lower debt underwriting fees . for a further discussion of investment banking fees , which are primarily recorded in ib , see the ib segment results on pages 40 201342 of this annual report . principal transactions revenue consists of trading revenue and private equity gains . trading revenue declined significantly from the 2006 level , primarily due to markdowns in ib of $ 1.4 billion ( net of hedges ) on subprime positions , including subprime cdos , and $ 1.3 billion ( net of fees ) on leveraged lending funded loans and unfunded commitments . also in ib , markdowns in securitized products on nonsubprime mortgages and weak credit trading performance more than offset record revenue in currencies and strong revenue in both rates and equities . equities benefited from strong client activity and record trading results across all products . ib 2019s credit portfolio results increased compared with the prior year , primarily driven by higher revenue from risk management activities . the increase in private equity gains from 2006 reflected a significantly higher level of gains , the classification of certain private equity carried interest as compensation expense and a fair value adjustment in the first quarter of 2007 on nonpublic private equity investments resulting from the adoption of sfas 157 ( 201cfair value measurements 201d ) . for a further discussion of principal transactions revenue , see the ib and corporate segment results on pages 40 201342 and 59 201360 , respectively , and note 6 on page 122 of this annual report . lending & deposit-related fees rose from the 2006 level , driven pri- marily by higher deposit-related fees and the bank of new york transaction . for a further discussion of lending & deposit-related fees , which are mostly recorded in rfs , tss and cb , see the rfs segment results on pages 43 201348 , the tss segment results on pages 54 201355 , and the cb segment results on pages 52 201353 of this annual report . asset management , administration and commissions revenue reached a level higher than the previous record set in 2006 . increased assets under management and higher performance and placement fees in am drove the record results . the 18% ( 18 % ) growth in assets under management from year-end 2006 came from net asset inflows and market appreciation across all segments : institutional , retail , private bank and private client services . tss also contributed to the rise in asset management , administration and commissions revenue , driven by increased product usage by new and existing clients and market appreciation on assets under custody . finally , commissions revenue increased , due mainly to higher brokerage transaction volume ( primarily included within fixed income and equity markets revenue of ib ) , which more than offset the sale of the insurance business by rfs in the third quarter of 2006 and a charge in the first quarter of 2007 resulting from accelerated surrenders of customer annuities . for additional information on these fees and commissions , see the segment discussions for ib on pages 40 201342 , rfs on pages 43 201348 , tss on pages 54 201355 , and am on pages 56 201358 , of this annual report

changes in exchange rates may either positively or negatively affect our consolidated revenues and expenses ( as expressed in u.s . dollars ) from foreign operations . the primary foreign currencies that impacted our results during 2015 included the australian dollar , brazilian real , british pound sterling and euro . based on 2015 exchange rates and operating results , if the u.s . dollar were

our international revenue and expenses remain constant at 2015 levels . the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally their respective local currency . assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date , and revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the period presented . the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss , net of tax , in the stockholders 2019 equity section of our consolidated balance sheets . our foreign subsidiaries generally collect revenues and pay expenses in their functional currency , mitigating transaction risk . however , certain subsidiaries may enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency . assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are susceptible to movements in foreign currency until final settlement . currency transaction gains or losses primarily arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency are included in office and general expenses . we regularly review our foreign exchange exposures that may have a material impact on our business and from time to time use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of potential adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates arising from these exposures . we do not enter into foreign exchange contracts or other derivatives for speculative purposes. .\nQuestion: what

europe . the catastrophe losses for 2009 were primarily related to an earthquake in asia , floods in europe , several weather-related events in the u.s. , and a european windstorm . for 2008 , the catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike . prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years . we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 . this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate . our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s . internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail . the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments . for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions . prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life

we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2018 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.2 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2018 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non- amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . marketing costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: .\n||2018|2017|\n|pension plans|1.61% ( 1.61 % )|1.51% ( 1.51 % )|\n|postretirement plans|3.97% ( 3.97 % )|3.79% ( 3.79 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 205 million as compared with approximately $ 160 million in 2018 , excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs . the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million . weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans . a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 50 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement .\nQuestion: by what percentage will the 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense be higher than that of 2018?\nAnswer:"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "0.28125"}]}

lack-of-order downtime in our u.s . uncoated paper and containerboard mills , and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in po- land and russia to add needed uncoated paper and pa- perboard capacity . we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations , im- proved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades , a more favorable product mix , and higher earn- ings from forestland and real estate sales . looking forward to 2006 , we expect operating prof- its for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter . sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter , but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses . price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are im- plemented . while energy , wood and raw material price movements are mixed , their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat . however , we see favorable signs of positive mo- mentum for the remainder of 2006 . we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger , and that we will realize 2005 fourth-quarter and 2006 first-quarter announced price increases . additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated

we test goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review . while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists , the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis . the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non-amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value . if the carrying value exceeds the fair value , goodwill or a non-amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired . to determine the fair value of goodwill , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model , supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry . at december 31 , 2018 , the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7.2 billion , which is related to ten reporting units , each of which consists of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics . the estimated fair value of each of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31 , 2018 . to determine the fair value of non-amortizable intangible assets , we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief-from-royalty method . we concluded that the fair value of our non- amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value . these discounted cash flow models include management assumptions relevant for forecasting operating cash flows , which are subject to changes in business conditions , such as volumes and prices , costs to produce , discount rates and estimated capital needs . management considers historical experience and all available information at the time the fair values are estimated , and we believe these assumptions are consistent with the assumptions a hypothetical marketplace participant would use . since the march 28 , 2008 , spin-off from altria group , inc. , we have not recorded a charge to earnings for an impairment of goodwill or non-amortizable intangible assets . marketing costs - we incur certain costs to support our products through programs that include advertising , marketing , consumer engagement and trade promotions . the costs of our advertising and marketing programs are expensed in accordance with u.s . gaap . recognition of the cost related to our consumer engagement and trade promotion programs contain uncertainties due to the judgment required in estimating the potential performance and compliance for each program . for volume-based incentives provided to customers , management continually assesses and estimates , by customer , the likelihood of the customer's achieving the specified targets , and records the reduction of revenue as the sales are made . for other trade promotions , management relies on estimated utilization rates that have been developed from historical experience . changes in the assumptions used in estimating the cost of any individual marketing program would not result in a material change in our financial position , results of operations or operating cash flows . employee benefit plans - as discussed in item 8 , note 13 . benefit plans to our consolidated financial statements , we provide a range of benefits to our employees and retired employees , including pensions , postretirement health care and postemployment benefits ( primarily severance ) . we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by u.s . gaap . these calculations include various actuarial assumptions , such as discount rates , assumed rates of return on plan assets , compensation increases , mortality , turnover rates and health care cost trend rates . we review actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so . as permitted by u.s . gaap , any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods . we believe that the assumptions utilized in calculating our obligations under these plans are reasonable based upon our historical experience and advice from our actuaries . weighted-average discount rate assumptions for pension and postretirement plan obligations at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 are as follows: .\n||2018|2017|\n|pension plans|1.61% ( 1.61 % )|1.51% ( 1.51 % )|\n|postretirement plans|3.97% ( 3.97 % )|3.79% ( 3.79 % )|\nwe anticipate that assumption changes will increase 2019 pre-tax pension and postretirement expense to approximately $ 205 million as compared with approximately $ 160 million in 2018 , excluding amounts related to employee severance and early retirement programs . the anticipated increase is primarily due to higher amortization out of other comprehensive earnings for unrecognized actuarial gains/ losses of $ 14 million , coupled with lower return on assets of $ 16 million , higher interest and service cost of $ 12 million and $ 4 million respectively , partially offset by other movements of $ 1 million . weighted-average expected rate of return and discount rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amount of expense reported for the employee benefit plans . a fifty-basis-point decrease in our discount rate would increase our 2019 pension and postretirement expense by approximately $ 50 million , and a fifty-basis-point increase in our discount rate would decrease our 2019 pension and postretirement .\nQuestion: what is the percentage change in weighted average discount rate for postretirement plans from 2017 to 2018?\nAnswer:"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "0.04749"}]}

only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31

30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due . generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated . at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is

of this report for additional information . loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate . initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program . if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program . our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal . temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs . further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs . additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification . typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate . a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed . permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs . for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance . examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment . permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made . residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with

catastrophe losses were primarily related to hurricanes gustav and ike . prior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years . we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior

refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the

first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from pre- vious accident years . we experienced $ 503 million of net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments in 2010 . this compares with net favorable prior period development in our p&c segments of $ 576 million and $ 814 million in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . refer to 201cprior period development 201d for more information . the adjusted loss and loss expense ratio declined in 2010 , compared with 2009 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , non-recurring premium adjustment and the reduction in assumed loss portfolio business , which is written at higher loss ratios than other types of business . our policy acquisition costs include commissions , premium taxes , underwriting , and other costs that vary with , and are primarily related to , the production of premium . administrative expenses include all other operating costs . our policy acquis- ition cost ratio increased in 2010 , compared with 2009 . the increase was primarily related to the impact of crop settlements , which generated higher profit-share commissions and a lower adjustment to net premiums earned , as well as the impact of reinstatement premiums expensed in connection with catastrophe activity and changes in business mix . our administrative expense ratio increased in 2010 , primarily due to the impact of the crop settlements , reinstatement premiums expensed , and increased costs in our international operations . although the crop settlements generate minimal administrative expenses , they resulted in lower adjustment to net premiums earned in 2010 , compared with 2009 . administrative expenses in 2010 , were partially offset by higher net results generated by our third party claims administration business , esis , the results of which are included within our administrative expenses . esis generated $ 85 million in net results in 2010 , compared with $ 26 million in 2009 . the increase is primarily from non-recurring sources . our policy acquisition cost ratio was stable in 2009 , compared with 2008 , as increases in our combined insurance operations were offset by more favorable final crop year settlement of profit share commissions . administrative expenses increased in 2009 , primarily due to the inclusion of administrative expenses related to combined insurance for the full year and costs associated with new product expansion in our domestic retail operation and in our personal lines business . our effective income tax rate , which we calculate as income tax expense divided by income before income tax , is depend- ent upon the mix of earnings from different jurisdictions with various tax rates . a change in the geographic mix of earnings would change the effective income tax rate . our effective income tax rate was 15 percent in 2010 , compared with 17 percent and 24 percent in 2009 and 2008 , respectively . the decrease in our effective income tax rate in 2010 , was primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings to lower tax-paying jurisdictions , a decrease in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits which was the result of a settlement with the u.s . internal revenue service appeals division regarding federal tax returns for the years 2002-2004 , and the recognition of a non-taxable gain related to the acquisition of rain and hail . the 2009 year included a reduction of a deferred tax valuation allowance related to investments . for 2008 , our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by a change in mix of earnings due to the impact of catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions . prior period development the favorable prior period development , inclusive of the life segment , of $ 512 million during 2010 was the net result of sev- eral underlying favorable and adverse movements . with respect to ace 2019s crop business , ace regularly receives reports from its managing general agent ( mga ) relating to the previous crop year ( s ) in subsequent calendar quarters and this typically results .\nQuestion: by what amount have catastrophic losses in 2010 surpass

insurance department regarding the use of two permitted practices in the statutory financial statements of its connecticut-domiciled life insurance subsidiaries as of december 31 , 2008 . the first permitted practice relates to the statutory accounting for deferred income taxes . specifically , this permitted practice modifies the accounting for deferred income taxes prescribed by the naic by increasing the realization period for deferred tax assets from one year to three years and increasing the asset recognition limit from 10% ( 10 % ) to 15% ( 15 % ) of adjusted statutory capital and surplus . the benefits of this permitted practice may not be considered by the company when determining surplus available for dividends . the second permitted practice relates to the statutory reserving requirements for variable annuities with guaranteed living benefit riders . actuarial guidelines prescribed by the naic require a stand-alone asset adequacy analysis reflecting only benefits , expenses and charges that are associated with the riders for variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits . the permitted practice allows for all benefits , expenses and charges associated with the variable annuity contract to be reflected in the stand- alone asset adequacy test . these permitted practices resulted in an increase to life operations estimated statutory surplus of $ 987

thereafter , respectively . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . based upon outstanding balances , and excluding purchased impaired loans , at december 31

30-89 days past due and approximately 5.57% ( 5.57 % ) were greater than or equal to 90 days past due . generally , when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated . at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr . see note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate . initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program . if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program . our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal . temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs . further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs . additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality and allowances for loan and lease losses and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to the original loan terms as of a specific date or the occurrence of an event , such as a failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the modification . typically , these modifications are for a period of up to 24 months after which the interest rate reverts to the original loan rate . a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed . permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs . for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance . examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment . permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made . residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months . we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses . the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer

if our long- term debt ratings were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase . conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease . changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility . under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants . these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth . in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to

existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are

stress testing the var and stress-test measures described above illustrate the total economic sensitivity of the firm 2019s consolidated balance sheets to changes in market variables . the effect of interest rate exposure on reported net income is also important . interest rate risk exposure in the firm 2019s core nontrading business activities ( i.e. , asset/liability management positions ) results from on 2013and off 2013balance sheet positions and can occur due to a variety of factors , including : 2022 differences in the timing among the maturity or repricing of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments . for example , if liabilities reprice quicker than assets and funding interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially . 2022 differences in the amounts of assets , liabilities and off 2013balance sheet instruments that are repricing at the same time . for example , if more deposit liabilities are repricing than assets when general interest rates are declining , earnings will increase initially . 2022 differences in the amounts by which short-term and long-term market interest rates change ( for example , changes in the slope of the yield curve , because the firm has the ability to lend at long-term fixed rates and borrow at variable or short- term fixed rates ) . based on these scenarios , the firm 2019s earnings would be affected negatively by a sudden and unanticipated increase in short-term rates paid on its liabilities ( e.g. , depos- its ) without a corresponding increase in long-term rates re- ceived on its assets ( e.g. , loans ) . conversely , higher long-term rates received on assets generally are beneficial to earnings , particularly when the increase is not accompanied by rising short-term rates paid on liabilities . 2022 the impact of changes in the maturity of various assets , liabili- ties or off 2013balance sheet instruments as interest rates change . for example , if more borrowers than forecasted pay down higher-rate loan balances when general interest rates are de- clining , earnings may decrease initially . the firm manages interest rate exposure related to its assets and liabilities on a consolidated , corporate-wide basis . business units transfer their interest rate risk to treasury through a transfer- pricing system , which takes into account the elements of interest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in financial markets . these elements include asset and liability balances and contrac- tual rates of interest , contractual principal payment schedules , expected prepayment experience , interest rate reset dates and maturities , rate indices used for repricing , and any interest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate products . all transfer-pricing assumptions are dynamically reviewed . the firm conducts simulations of changes in net interest income from its nontrading activities under a variety of interest rate scenarios . earnings-at-risk tests measure the potential change in the firm 2019s net interest income , and the corresponding impact to the firm 2019s pretax earnings , over the following 12 months . these tests highlight exposures to various rate-sensitive factors , such as the rates themselves ( e.g. , the prime lending rate ) , pricing strate- gies on deposits , optionality and changes in product mix . the tests include forecasted balance sheet changes , such as asset sales and securitizations , as well as prepayment and reinvestment behavior . immediate changes in interest rates present a limited view of risk , and so a number of alternative scenarios are also reviewed . these scenarios include the implied forward curve , nonparallel rate shifts and severe interest rate shocks on selected key rates . these scenar- ios are intended to provide a comprehensive view of jpmorgan chase 2019s earnings at risk over a wide range of outcomes . jpmorgan chase 2019s 12-month pretax earnings sensitivity profile as of december 31 , 2009 and 2008 , is as follows. .\n|( in millions )|immediate change in rates +200bp|immediate change in rates +100bp|immediate change in rates -100bp|immediate change in

earnings- at-risk results of such a low-probability scenario are not meaningful . the change in earnings at risk from december 31 , 2008 , results from a higher level of afs securities and an updated baseline scenario that uses higher short-term interest rates . the firm 2019s risk to rising rates is largely the result of increased funding costs on assets , partially offset by widening deposit margins , which are currently compressed due to very low short-term interest rates . additionally , another interest rate scenario , involving a steeper yield curve with long-term rates rising 100 basis points and short- term rates staying at current levels , results in a 12-month pretax earnings benefit of $ 449 million . the increase in earnings is due to reinvestment of maturing assets at the higher long-term rates , with funding costs remaining unchanged . risk identification for large exposures individuals who manage risk positions , particularly those that are complex , are responsible for identifying potential losses that could arise from specific , unusual events , such as a potential tax change , and estimating the probabilities of losses arising from such events . this information is entered into the firm 2019s rifle database . management of trading businesses control rifle entries , thereby permitting the firm to monitor further earnings vulnerability not adequately covered by standard risk measures . risk monitoring and control limits market risk is controlled primarily through a series of limits . limits reflect the firm 2019s risk appetite in the context of the market environment and business strategy . in setting limits , the firm takes into consideration factors such as market volatility , product liquidity , business trends and management

a prospective basis . this change does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation . 2016 vs . 2015 pension expense , excluding special items , decreased from the prior year due to the adoption of the spot rate approach which reduced service cost and interest cost , the impact from expected return on assets and demographic gains , partially offset by the impact of the adoption of new mortality tables for our major plans . special items of $ 7.3 included pension settlement losses of $ 6.4 , special termination benefits of $ 2.0 , and curtailment gains of $ 1.1 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2015 vs . 2014 the decrease in pension expense , excluding special items , was due to the impact from expected return on assets , a 40 bp reduction in the weighted average compensation increase assumption , and lower service cost and interest cost . the decrease was partially offset by the impact of higher amortization of actuarial losses , which resulted primarily from a 60 bp decrease in weighted average discount rate . special items of $ 35.2 included pension settlement losses of $ 21.2 , special termination benefits of $ 8.7 , and curtailment losses of $ 5.3 . these resulted primarily from our recent business restructuring and cost reduction actions . 2017 outlook in 2017 , pension expense , excluding special items , is estimated to be approximately $ 70 to $ 75 , an increase of $ 10 to $ 15 from 2016 , resulting primarily from a decrease in discount rates , offset by favorable asset experience , effects of the versum spin-off and the adoption of new mortality tables . pension settlement losses of $ 10 to $ 15 are expected , dependent on the timing of retirements . in 2017 , we expect pension expense to include approximately $ 164 for amortization of actuarial losses compared to $ 121 in 2016 . net actuarial losses of $ 484 were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income in 2016 , primarily attributable to lower discount rates and improved mortality projections . actuarial gains/losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not

2019s discussion and analysis net revenues in equities were $ 7.83 billion for 2015 , 16% ( 16 % ) higher than 2014 . excluding a gain of $ 121 million ( $ 30 million and $ 91 million included in equities client execution and securities services , respectively ) in 2014 related to the extinguishment of certain of our junior subordinated debt , net revenues in equities were 18% ( 18 % ) higher than 2014 , primarily due to significantly higher net revenues in equities client execution across the major regions , reflecting significantly higher results in both derivatives and cash products , and higher net revenues in securities services , reflecting the impact of higher average customer balances and improved securities lending spreads . commissions and fees were essentially unchanged compared with 2014 . we elect the fair value option for certain unsecured borrowings . the fair value net gain attributable to the impact of changes in our credit spreads on these borrowings was $ 255 million ( $ 214 million and $ 41 million related to fixed income , currency and commodities client execution and equities client execution , respectively ) for 2015 , compared with a net gain of $ 144

billion for 2015 , 28% ( 28 % ) higher than 2014 , due to significantly higher net provisions for mortgage-related litigation and regulatory matters , partially offset by decreased compensation and benefits expenses . pre-tax earnings were $ 1.21 billion in 2015 , 72% ( 72 % ) lower than 2014 . investing & lending investing & lending includes our investing activities and the origination of loans

performance , particularly in the energy sector , in the first quarter of 2016 , market conditions improved during the rest of the year as macroeconomic concerns moderated . global equity markets increased during 2016 , contributing to net gains from investments in public equities , and corporate performance rebounded from the difficult start to the year . if macroeconomic concerns negatively affect corporate performance or company-specific events , or if global equity markets decline , net revenues in investing & lending would likely be negatively impacted . although net revenues in investing & lending for 2015 benefited from favorable company-specific events , including sales , initial public offerings and financings , a decline in global equity prices and widening high-yield credit spreads during the second half of 2015 impacted results . 2016 versus 2015 . net revenues in investing & lending were $ 4.08 billion for 2016 , 25% ( 25 % ) lower than 2015 . this decrease was primarily due to significantly lower net revenues from investments in equities , primarily reflecting a significant decrease in net gains from private equities , driven by company-specific events and corporate performance . in addition , net revenues in debt securities and loans were lower compared with 2015 , reflecting significantly lower net revenues related to relationship lending activities , due to the impact of changes in credit spreads on economic hedges . losses related to these hedges were $ 596 million in 2016 , compared with gains of $ 329 million in 2015 . this decrease was partially offset by higher net gains from investments in debt instruments and higher net interest income . see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about economic hedges related to our relationship lending activities . operating expenses were $ 2.39 billion for 2016 , essentially unchanged compared with 2015 . pre-tax earnings were $ 1.69 billion in 2016 , 44%

from investments in equities , principally reflecting the sale of metro in the fourth quarter of 2014 and lower net gains from investments in private equities , driven by corporate performance . in

capital credit risk capital is estimated separately for the wholesale business- es ( ib , cb , tss and am ) and consumer businesses ( rfs and cs ) . credit risk capital for the overall wholesale credit portfolio is defined in terms of unexpected credit losses , both from defaults and declines in the portfolio value due to credit deterioration , measured over a one-year period at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . unexpected losses are losses in excess of those for which provisions for credit losses are maintained . the capital methodology is based upon several principal drivers of credit risk : exposure at default ( or loan-equivalent amount ) , default likelihood , credit spreads , loss severity and portfolio correlation . credit risk capital for the consumer portfolio is based upon product and other relevant risk segmentation . actual segment level default and severity experience are used to estimate unexpected losses for a one-year horizon at a confidence level consistent with an 201caa 201d credit rating standard . statistical results for certain segments or portfolios are adjusted to ensure that capital is consistent with external bench- marks , such as subordination levels on market transactions or capital held at representative monoline competitors , where appropriate . market risk capital the firm calculates market risk capital guided by the principle that capital should reflect the risk of loss in the value of portfolios and financial instruments caused by adverse movements in market vari- ables , such as interest and foreign exchange rates , credit spreads , securities prices and commodities prices . daily value-at-risk ( 201cvar 201d ) , biweekly stress-test results and other factors are used to determine appropriate capital levels . the firm allocates market risk capital to each business segment according to a formula that weights that seg- ment 2019s var and stress-test exposures . see market risk management on pages 111 2013116 of this annual report for more information about these market risk measures . operational risk capital capital is allocated to the lines of business for operational risk using a risk-based capital allocation methodology which estimates opera- tional risk on a bottom-up basis . the operational risk capital model is based upon actual losses and potential scenario-based stress losses , with adjustments to the capital calculation to reflect changes in the quality of the control environment or the use of risk-transfer prod- ucts . the firm believes its model is consistent with the new basel ii framework . private equity risk capital capital is allocated to privately and publicly held securities , third-party fund investments and commitments in the private equity portfolio to cover the potential loss associated with a decline in equity markets and related asset devaluations . in addition to negative market fluctua- tions , potential losses in private equity investment portfolios can be magnified by liquidity risk . the capital allocation for the private equity portfolio is based upon measurement of the loss experience suffered by the firm and other market participants over a prolonged period of adverse equity market conditions . regulatory capital the board of governors of the federal reserve system ( the 201cfederal reserve 201d ) establishes capital requirements , including well-capitalized standards for the consolidated financial holding company . the office of the comptroller of the currency (

104 mil- lion compared with $ 48 million in 2006 and $ 37 mil- lion in 2005 . the benefits from higher sales price realizations were partially offset by increased input costs for energy , chemicals and freight . entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly . however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix . industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased 6% ( 6 % ) to $ 5.2 billion compared with $ 4.9 bil- lion in 2006 , and 13% ( 13 % ) compared with $ 4.6 billion in 2005 . operating profits in 2007 were 26% ( 26 % ) higher than in 2006 and more than double 2005 earnings . bene- fits from improved price realizations ( $ 147 million ) , sales volume increases net of increased lack of order downtime ( $ 3 million ) , a more favorable mix ( $ 31 million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher freight costs ( $ 18 million ) . in addition , a gain of $ 13 million was recognized in 2006 related to a sale of property in spain and costs of $ 52 million were incurred in 2007 related to the conversion of the paper machine at pensacola to production of lightweight linerboard . the segment took 165000 tons of downtime in 2007 which included 16000 tons of market-related downtime compared

that was converted to lightweight linerboard during 2007 . average sales price realizations were significantly higher than in 2006 reflecting price increases announced early in 2006 and in the third quarter of 2007 . margins improved reflecting stronger export demand . manu- facturing performance was strong , although costs associated with planned mill maintenance outages were higher due to timing of outages . raw material costs for wood , energy , chemicals and recycled fiber increased significantly . operating results for 2007 were also unfavorably impacted by $ 52 million of costs associated with the conversion and startup of the pensacola paper machine . u.s . converting sales volumes were slightly lower in 2007 compared with 2006 reflecting softer customer box demand . earnings improvement in 2007 bene- fited from the realization of box price increases announced in early 2006 and late 2007 . favorable manufacturing operations and higher sales prices for waste fiber more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 . however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are expected to rise , particularly for wood and energy . manufacturing operations should be favorable compared with the fourth quarter . european industrial packaging net sales for 2007 were $ 1.1 billion , up from $ 1.0 billion in 2006 and $ 880 million in 2005 . sales volumes were about flat as early stronger demand in the industrial segment weakened in the second half of the year . operating profits in 2007 were $ 88 million compared with $ 69 million in 2006 and $ 53 million in 2005 . sales margins improved reflecting increased sales prices for boxes . conversion costs were favorable as the result of manufacturing improvement programs . entering the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes should be strong seasonally across all regions as the winter fruit and vegetable season continues

and freight . entering the first quarter of 2008 , demand for market pulp remains strong , and average sales price realiza- tions should increase slightly . however , input costs for energy , chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix . industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased

million ) , strong mill and converting operations ( $ 33 million ) and other costs ( $ 47 million ) were partially offset by the effects of higher raw material costs ( $ 76 million ) and higher

more than offset significantly higher raw material and freight costs . looking ahead to the first quarter of 2008 , sales volumes are expected to increase slightly , and results should benefit from a full-quarter impact of the price increases announced in the third quarter of 2007 . however , additional mill maintenance outages are planned for the first quarter , and freight and input costs are

matter , liability for cercla cleanups is typically allocated among the many potential responsible parties . remedial costs are recorded in the consolidated financial statements when they become

of the matters referenced above is a closed wood treating facility located in cass lake , minneso- ta . during 2009 , in connection with an environmental site remediation action under cercla , international paper submitted to the epa a site remediation feasi- bility study . in june 2011 , the epa selected and published a proposed soil remedy at the site with an estimated cost of $ 46 million . the overall remediation reserve for the site is currently $ 48 mil- lion to address this selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy deci- sion would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean-up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and sig- nificantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to per- form a natural resource damage assessment . it is premature to predict the

financial condition and results of operations executive summary international paper 2019s operating results in 2005 were strongly impacted by significantly higher costs for en- ergy , wood , caustic soda and other raw materials which reduced operating profits compared with 2004 by $ 586 million . lower sales volumes were also a negative factor versus 2004 as we took a significant amount of lack-of-order downtime in our u.s . uncoated paper and containerboard mills , and downtime in our eastern european operations to rebuild paper machines in po- land and russia to add needed uncoated paper and pa- perboard capacity . we were able to partially offset some of these negative impacts through operational improvements in our manufacturing operations , im- proved average pricing for our paper and packaging grades , a more favorable product mix , and higher earn- ings from forestland and real estate sales . looking forward to 2006 , we expect operating prof- its for the first quarter to be flat with the 2005 fourth quarter . sales volumes should be seasonally slow in the quarter , but should show some improvement as the quarter progresses . price realizations should also improve as previously announced price increases are im- plemented . while energy , wood and raw material price movements are mixed , their impact for the quarter is expected to be flat . however , we see favorable signs of positive mo- mentum for the remainder of 2006 . we anticipate that demand in north america for both uncoated paper and industrial packaging products will be stronger , and that we will realize 2005 fourth-quarter and 2006 first-quarter announced price increases . additionally , operating rates should improve in 2006 reflecting announced industry capacity reductions in uncoated papers and container- board . we are also starting to see some reductions in natural gas and southern wood costs that , if the trend continues , should benefit operations as the year pro- gresses . in connection with our overall strategic direction , we are evaluating options for the possible sale or spin-off of certain of our businesses as previously announced in our transformation plan , with decisions on certain businesses anticipated during 2006 . we also will con- tinue to improve our key operations in north america by realigning our uncoated and packaging mill oper- ations to reduce costs , improve our products and im- prove our overall profitability . results of operations industry segment operating profits are used by international paper 2019s management to measure the earn-

f0b7 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets ; f0b7 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices ; and f0b7 expected salvage to be received upon retirement . for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track . it has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ( i.e. , the amount of weight carried over the rail ) . the service lives also vary based on rail weight , rail condition ( e.g. , new or secondhand ) , and rail type ( e.g. , straight or curve ) . our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives . for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail ( i.e. , the weight of loaded and empty freight cars , locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail ) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile . rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material . based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2013 , the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years . for all other depreciable assets , we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives .\nQuestion: what was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2011 to 2012?\nAnswer:"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "-1.0"}]}

f0b7 evaluation of any expected changes in current operations and the outlook for continued use of the assets ; f0b7 evaluation of technological advances and changes to maintenance practices ; and f0b7 expected salvage to be received upon retirement . for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track . it has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage ( i.e. , the amount of weight carried over the rail ) . the service lives also vary based on rail weight , rail condition ( e.g. , new or secondhand ) , and rail type ( e.g. , straight or curve ) . our depreciation studies for rail in high density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives . for rail in high-density traffic corridors , we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail ( i.e. , the weight of loaded and empty freight cars , locomotives and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail ) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile . rail in high-density traffic corridors accounts for approximately 70 percent of the historical cost of rail and other track material . based on the number of gross ton-miles carried over our rail in high density traffic corridors during 2013 , the estimated service lives of the majority of this rail ranged from approximately 15 years to approximately 30 years . for all other depreciable assets , we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives .\nQuestion: what was the net change in the number of environmental sites from 2012 to 2013?\nAnswer:"}, {"from": "assistant", "value": "-16.0"}]}

chemicals and freight are expected to be higher , and increased spending is anticipated for planned mill maintenance outages . industrial packaging demand for industrial packaging products is closely correlated with non-durable industrial goods pro- duction , as well as with demand for processed foods , poultry , meat and agricultural products . in addition to prices and volumes , major factors affecting the profitability of industrial packaging are raw material and energy costs , freight costs , manufacturing effi- ciency and product mix . industrial packaging net sales for 2007 increased

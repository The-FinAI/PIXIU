## Overview

Welcome to the **PIXIU** project! This project is designed to support the development, fine-tuning, and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the financial domain. PIXIU is a significant step towards understanding and harnessing the power of LLMs in the financial domain.

### Structure of the Repository

The repository is organized into several key components, each serving a unique purpose in the financial NLP pipeline:

- **FLARE**: Our Financial Language Understanding and Prediction Evaluation Benchmark. FLARE serves as the evaluation suite for financial LLMs, with a focus on understanding and prediction tasks across various financial contexts.
- **FIT**: Our Financial Instruction Dataset. FIT is a multi-task and multi-modal instruction dataset specifically tailored for financial tasks. It serves as the training ground for fine-tuning LLMs for these tasks.

- **FinMA**: Our Financial Large Language Model (LLM). FinMA is the core of our project, providing the learning and prediction power for our financial tasks.

### Key Features

- **Open resources**: PIXIU openly provides the financial LLM, instruction tuning data, and datasets included in the evaluation benchmark to encourage open research and transparency.
  
- **Multi-task**: The instruction tuning data and benchmark in PIXIU cover a diverse set of financial tasks, including four financial NLP tasks and one financial prediction task.
- **Multi-modality**: PIXIU's instruction tuning data and benchmark consist of multi-modality financial data, including time series data from the stock movement prediction task. It covers various types of financial texts, including reports, news articles, tweets, and regulatory filings.
- **Diversity**: Unlike previous benchmarks focusing mainly on financial NLP tasks, PIXIU's evaluation benchmark includes critical financial prediction tasks aligned with real-world scenarios, making it more challenging.

    --name pixiu \
    -v $pixiu_path:$pixiu_path \
    -v $hf_home:$hf_home \
    -v $ssh_pub_key:/root/.ssh/authorized_keys \
    -w $workdir \
    $docker_user/pixiu:$tag \
    [--sshd_port 2201 --cmd "echo 'Hello, world!' && /bin/bash"]
```
Arguments explain:
- `[]` means ignoreable arguments
- `HF_HOME`: huggingface cache dir
- `sshd_port`: sshd port of the container, you can run `ssh -i private_key -p $sshd_port root@$ip` to connect to the container, default to 22001
- `--rm`: remove the container when exit container (ie.`CTRL + D`)

#### Automated Task Assessment

For automated evaluation, please follow these instructions:

1. Huggingface Transformer

   To evaluate a model hosted on the HuggingFace Hub (for instance, finma-7b-full), use this command:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH='$abs_path/PIXIU/src:$abs_path/PIXIU/src/financial-evaluation'
python eval.py \
    --model "hf-causal-experimental" \
    --model_args "use_accelerate=True,pretrained=chancefocus/finma-7b-full,tokenizer=chancefocus/finma-7b-full,use_fast=False" \
    --tasks "flare_ner,flare_sm_acl,flare_fpb"
```

More details can be found in the [lm_eval](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) documentation.

2. Commercial APIs


Please note, for tasks such as NER, the automated evaluation is based on a specific pattern. This might fail to extract relevant information in zero-shot settings, resulting in relatively lower performance compared to previous human-annotated results.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH='$abs_path/PIXIU/src:$abs_path/PIXIU/src/lm-evaluation-harness'
export OPENAI_API_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE
python eval.py \
    --model gpt-4 \
    --tasks flare_ner,flare_sm_acl,flare_fpb
```

#### Self-Hosted Evaluation

To run inference backend:

```bash
bash scripts/run_interface.sh
```

Please adjust run_interface.sh according to your environment requirements.

To evaluate:

```bash
python data/*/evaluate.py
```

### Create new tasks

Creating a new task for FLARE involves creating a Huggingface dataset and implementing the task in a Python file. This guide walks you through each step of setting up a new classification task using the FLARE framework

#### Creating your dataset in Huggingface

Your dataset should be created in the following format:

```python
{
    "query": "...",
    "answer": "...",
    "text": "..."
}
```

In this format:

- `query`: Combination of your prompt and text
- `answer`: Your label

For classification tasks, additional keys should be defined:

- `choices`: Set of labels
- `gold`: Index of the correct label in choices (Start from 0)

#### Implementing the task

Once your dataset is ready, you can start implementing your task. Your task should be defined within a new class in flare.py or any other Python file located within the tasks directory.

For a classification task, we provide a convenient base class called `Classification`. You can directly use this class to build your task. Let's illustrate this with an example of implementing a task named FLARE-FPB:

```python
class FlareFPB(Classification):
    DATASET_PATH = "flare-fpb"
    DATASET_NAME = "none"
```

And that's it! Once you've created your task class, the next step is to register it in the `src/tasks/__init__.py` file. To do this, add a new line following the format `"task_name": module.ClassName`. Here is how it's done:

```python
TASK_REGISTRY = {
    "flare_fpb": flare.FPB,
    "your_new_task": your_module.YourTask,  # This is where you add your task
}
```

Please note, the Classification base class provides three default metrics:

- **Accuracy**: This metric represents the ratio of correctly predicted observations to total observations. It is calculated as (True Positives + True Negatives) / Total Observations.
- **F1 Score**: The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between these two metrics. It's useful in cases where one measure is more important than the other. The F1 score is at its best at 1 (perfect precision and recall) and worst at 0.
- **Missing Ratio**: This metric calculates the proportion of responses where no options from the given choices in the task are returned.
  Moreover, you can specify `CALCULATE_MCC` in your class definition to include the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The MCC is a measure of the quality of binary classifications. It returns a value between -1 and +1. A coefficient of +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 an average random prediction and -1 an inverse prediction.

> For more custom metrics or requests, you may refer to `flare.NER` or `flare.FinQA` for examples.

## FIT: Financial Instruction Dataset

Our instruction dataset is uniquely tailored for the domain-specific LLM, FinMA. This dataset has been meticulously assembled to fine-tune our model on a diverse range of financial tasks. It features publicly available multi-task and multi-modal data derived from the multiple open released financial datasets.

The dataset is multi-faceted, featuring tasks including sentiment analysis, news headline classification, named entity recognition, question answering, and stock movement prediction. It covers both textual and time-series data modalities, offering a rich variety of financial data. The task specific instruction prompts for each task have been carefully degined by domain experts.

### Modality and Prompts

The table below summarizes the different tasks, their corresponding modalities, text types, and examples of the instructions used for each task:

| ---------------------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sentiment Analysis           | Text              | news headlines,tweets | "Analyze the sentiment of this statement extracted from a financial news article.Provide your answer as either negative, positive or neutral. For instance, 'The company's stocks plummeted following the scandal.' would be classified as negative." |
| News Headline Classification | Text              | News Headlines        | "Consider whether the headline mentions the price of gold. Is there a Price or Not in the gold commodity market indicated in the news headline? Please answer Yes or No." |
| Named Entity Recognition     | Text              | financial agreements  | "In the sentences extracted from financial agreements in U.S. SEC filings, identify the named entities that represent a person ('PER'), an organization ('ORG'), or a location ('LOC'). The required answer format is: 'entity name, entity type'. For instance, in 'Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, announced the launch from Cape Canaveral.', the entities would be: 'Elon Musk, PER; SpaceX, ORG; Cape Canaveral, LOC'" |
| Question Answering           | Text              | earnings reports      | "In the context of this series of interconnected finance-related queries and the additional information provided by the pretext, table data, and post text from a company's financial filings, please provide a response to the final question. This may require extracting information from the context and performing mathematical calculations. Please take into account the information provided in the preceding questions and their answers when formulating your response:" |
| Stock Movement Prediction    | Text, Time-Series | tweets, Stock Prices  | "Analyze the information and social media posts to determine if the closing price of *\{tid\}* will ascend or descend at *\{point\}*. Please respond with either Rise or Fall." |

### Generating Datasets for FIT

When you are working with the Financial Instruction Dataset (FIT), it's crucial to follow the prescribed format for training and testing models.

The format should look like this:

```json
{
    "id": "unique id",
    "conversations": [
        {
            "from": "human",
            "value": "Your prompt and text"
        },
        {
            "from": "agent",
            "value": "Your answer"
        }
    ],
    "text": "Text to be classified",
    "label": "Your label"
}
```

Here's what each field means:

- "id": a unique identifier for each example in your dataset.
- "conversations": a list of conversation turns. Each turn is represented as a dictionary, with "from" representing the speaker, and "value" representing the text spoken in the turn.
- "text": the text to be classified.
- "label": the ground truth label for the text.


The first turn in the "conversations" list should always be from "human", and contain your prompt and the text. The second turn should be from "agent", and contain your answer.
